        This is the first time that the Tails builder virtual machine is
        started. The virtual machine template is about 300 MB to download,
        so the process might take some time.

        Please remember to shut the virtual machine down once your work on
        Tails in done:

            $ rake vm:halt

      END_OF_MESSAGE
