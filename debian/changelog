  - more user-friendly shell, umask 077
  - updated panel, added launcher to restart Tor
  - mv $HOME/bin/* /usr/local/bin/
  - removed metacity sessions

  - removed .gnome/gnome-vfs/.trash_entry_cache
  - removed kconf_update log

  * iceweasel
  - enable caching in RAM
  - explicitly disable ssl v2, and enable ssl v3 + tls
  - removed prefs for the non-installed webdeveloper
  - removed the SSL Blacklist extension (not so useful, licensing issues)
  - deep profile directory cleanup
  - extensions cleanup: prefer Debian-packaged ones, cleanly reinstalled
    AddBlock Plus and CS Lite to allow upgrading them
  - updated pluginreg.dat and localstore.rdf
  - moved some settings to user.js
  - made cookie/JavaScript whitelists more consistent
  - force httpS on whitelisted sites
  - NoScript: marked google and gmail as untrusted
  - some user interface tweaks, mainly for NoScript
  - FireGPG: disable the buggy auto-detection feature, the link to firegpg's
    homepage in generated pgp messages and the GMail interface (which won't
    work without JavaScript anyway)
  - updated blocklist.xml
  - removed and excluded a bunch of files in the profile directory
  * icedove: clean the profile directory up just like we did for iceweasel
  * software: install msmtp and mutt
  * home-refresh
  - use rsync rather than tar
  * documentation
  - various fixes
  - reviewed pidgin-otr security (see TODO)
  * build system
  - stop calling home-refresh in lh_build
  - include home-refresh in generated images
  - gitignore update
  - fix permissions on local includes at build time
  - updated scripts/{build,clean} wrt. new $HOME handling
  - scripts/{build,config}: stop guessing BASEDIR, we must be run from
    the root of the source directory anyway
  - stop storing /etc/amnesia/version in Git, delete it at clean time
  * release
  - converted Changelog to the Debian format and location, updated
    build scripts accordingly
  - added a README symlink at the root of the source directory
  - basic debian/ directory (not working for building packages yet,
    but at least we can now use git-dch)
  - added debian/gbp.conf with our custom options for git-dch
  - config/amnesia: introduce new $AMNESIA_DEV_* variables to be used
    by developpers' scripts
  - added ./release script: a wrapper around git-dch, git-commit and git-tag

amnesia (0.1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Forked Privatix 9.03.15, by Markus Mandalka:
  http://mandalka.name/privatix/index.html.en
  Everything has since been rewritten or so heavily changed that nothing
  remains from the original code... apart of a bunch of Gnome settings.
  * hardware support:
  - install a bunch of non-free wifi firmwares
  - install xsane and add the live user to the scanner group
  - install aircrack-ng
  - install xserver-xorg-video-geode on i386 (eCafe support)
  - install xserver-xorg-video-all
  - install firmware-linux from backports.org
  - install system-config-printer
  - added instructions in README.eCAFE to support the Hercules eCAFE EC-800
    netbook
  * APT:
  - configure pinning to support installing chosen packages from
    squeeze; the APT source for testing is hardcoded in chroot_sources/,
    since there is no way to use $LH_CHROOT_MIRROR in chroot_local-hooks
  - give backports.org priority 200, so that we track upgrades of packages
    installed from there
  * release: include the Changelog and TODO in the generated images,
  in the   /usr/share/doc/amnesia/ directory
  * software: install gnomebaker when building Gnome-based live OS, to
  easily clone myself when running from CD
  * build system
  - build i386 images when the build host is amd64
  - added a version file: /etc/amnesia/version
  - use snapshot live-* packages inside the images
  - setup timezone depending on the chosen build locale
  - rely on standard live-initramfs adduser to do our user setup
    (including sudo vs. Gnome/KDE, etc.)
  - stop "supporting" KDE
  - allow building several images at once
  - migrated most of lh_config invocations to scripts/config
  - append "noprompt" so that halting/rebooting work with splashy
  - moved our own variables to config/amnesia, using the namespace
    $AMNESIA_*
  * iceweasel
  - default search engine is now Scroogle SSL, configured to search pages
    in French language; the English one is also installed
  - never ask to save passwords or forms content
  - configured the torbutton extension to use polipo
  - installed the CACert root certificate
  - installed the SSL Blacklist extension and the blacklist data
  - installed the FireGPG extension
  - installed the CS Lite extension
  - installed the NoScript extension
  - NoScript, CS Lite: replaced the default whitelists with a list of
    trusted, non-commercial Internet Service Providers
  - configure extensions (add to prefs.js):
    user_pref("extensions.torbutton.startup", true);
    user_pref("extensions.torbutton.startup_state", 1);
    user_pref("extensions.torbutton.tor_enabled", true);
    user_pref("noscript.notify.hide", true);
    user_pref("capability.policy.maonoscript.sites", "about:
      about:blank about:certerror about:config about:credits
      about:neterror about:plugins about:privatebrowsing
      about:sessionrestore chrome: resource:");
    user_pref("extensions.firegpg.no_updates", true);
  - install the NoScript plugin from Debian squeeze
  - delete urlclassifier3.sqlite on $HOME refresh: as we disabled
    "safebrowsing", this huge file is of no use
  - torbutton: install newer version from Squeeze
  * linux: removed non-686 kernel flavours when building i386 images
  * compatibility: append "live-media=removable live-media-timeout=15", to
    prevent blindly booting another debian-live installed on the hard disk
  * software: added
  - gnome-app-install
  - iwconfig
  - cryptkeeper: Gnome system tray applet to encrypt files with EncFS
  - kvkbd: virtual keyboard (installed from backports.org)
  - sshfs (and added live user to the fuse group)
  - less, secure-delete, wipe, seahorse, sshfs, ntfs-3g
  - scribus
  * Tor
  - enable the transparent proxy, the DNS resolver, and the control port
  - save authentication cookie to /tmp/control_auth_cookie, so that the
    live user can use Tork and co.
  - autostart Tork with Gnome
  - Tork: installed, disabled most notifications and startup tips
  - added a restart tor hook to if-up.d (used by Network Manager as well),
    so that Tor does work immediately even if the network cable was
    plugged late in/after the boot process
  * $HOME
  - added a nautilus-script to wipe files and directories
  - bash with working completion for the live user
  * polipo: install and configure this HTTP proxy to forward requests
  through Tor
  * DNS: install and configure pdnsd to forward any DNS request through
  the Tor resolver
  * firewall: force every outgoing TCP connection through the Tor
  transparent proxy, discard any outgoing UDP connection
  * misc
  - set syslinux timeout to 4 seconds
  - use splashy for more user-friendly boot/halt sequences
