    helpers don't understand the "noautoconfig" option anymore, which
    has been renamed to "noauto" in a way that is not backward-
    compatible.

  * Use {lenny,squeeze} in built files names instead of AMNESIA_BASE.
    We'll think about re-adding AMNESIA_BASE (= gnome, ...) when we
    start building a second flavour. In the meantime, the main two
    flavours are different on the base distribution criterion.
  * Added pointer to autotesting update thread.

  [ 127.0.0.1 ]

  * Disable Debian live snapshot repository. We're not ready for the

  * Use live-helper brand new support for isohybrid options. ... instead
    of doing the isohybrid conversion ourselves. The default binary
    image type we build is now iso-hybrid. Bump dependency on live-
    helper to current Squeeze's 2.0~a14-1, and on syslinux to current
    Squeeze's 3.86 to make sure isohybrid is supported by both.

  * Made a few scripts executable.
  * amnesia-security-check: got rid of the dependency on File::Slurp.
    Adding a dependency just to read the first line of a file was a bit
    too much. Our Perl-foo has gone a bit stronger since then.

    bpo kernel.

  * Migrate to live-boot / live-config instead of live-initramfs. Tons
    of involved changes. The $HOME files have been moved to /etc/skel in
    order to get rid of permissions problems: we now let adduser deal
    with this. New custom packages:  - live-boot 2.0~a16-1+tails1.cb5e34
    built from our Git repository. It    integrates the changes our
    custom live-initramfs had.  - live-config patched with xserver-xorg
    related fixes sent today on the Debian    Live ML; hopefully this is
    only temporary...

  * Remove custom live-config* packages as the dexconf bug has been
    fixed. This means these packages are fetched from Squeeze at build
    time. Squeeze currently has 2.0.2-1. Some more bugs might be fixed
    in Sid's 2.0.6-1, but let's try the soon-stable way first.
  * New custom live-boot package. Built from our repository's Git commit
    f1a9bdbb343c7e9d01b000b007954dcefe0a3f5e. Needs testing.
  * PO files update with newer po4a
  * Git: ignore .lock file created by live-build
  * Fix permissions at early live-config stage. Else other live-config
    scripts, such as 003-sudo, are unable to do their job with the live
    user's credentials.
  * Prefer linux-headers-2.6-686 and linux-libc-dev from backports. This
    will hopefully fix the VirtualBox modules building by making it
    possible to install the kernel headers that match the installed
    kernel.
  * Support arch-dependent packages for {amd64,powerpc} too in pinning
    configuration.
  * New custom Vidalia package based on 0.2.10.
  * No need to bootstrap permissions at early live-config stage. This
    was a (non-working) workaround for an obsolete dev build environment
    :/
  * New live-boot packages.
  * Closing unreproducible bugs. Needed debugging info never came :/
  * WIP: start Tor and Vidalia only once HTP is done.
  * WIP: fetch live-config packages from sid. It fixes annoying bugs the
    Squeeze packages have. This is temporary as live-config 2.0.6 will
    land in Squeeze in 3 days. Then we'll be able to get back to
    Squeeze's live-config in pinning, and remove sid sources.
  * bugs++
  * mv etc/live/config.conf.d etc/live/config.d. This is the place were
    live-config 2.0.6 looks for config files.
  * Fix two places where the live username was still hardcoded.
  * update todo
  * add research results
  * Install gfshare and ssss. Those are implementations of [Shamir's
    Secret
    Sharing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing).
    Each one has its own pros and cons, but they both are very small, so
    we can afford installing both.
  * the build locale seems fixed already => todo--
  * add research results
  * testing PO editors
  * software: install poedit (=> todo--)

  [ 127.0.0.1 ]
  * added toc to long page

  * wording
  * Stop pretending supporting anything else than GNOME-based images.
    Once we have marked todo/flavour_with_lighter_desktop_environment as
    wontfix, it makes little sense to keep conditionals at some places
    of the code, while most other places simply assume we are using
    GNOME.
  * Add precision.
  * updated reasons not to do it
  * Disable Tor automatic startup at build time rather than at boot
    time.
  * Actually enable the initscript that enables wifi power management.
  * added test results, need more
  * add test results
  * install virt-what instead of imvirt
  * Cleanup packages list. - do not list packages that have Priority:
    required - do not list packages that are mainly needed in
    combination with another one,   that depends on it anyway (e.g.
    mkisofs vs. any CD burning GUI we install) - do not install dialog,
    mc, live-build and xterm. if other packages depend on   them, we'll
    get them, else... seriously, who will miss them?
  * Install tor-geoipdb to help the Tor network.
  * Update refresh-translations script. - support amnesia-htp-notify-
    user - support all supported languages
  * Generated pot/po/mo files for i18n'd custom programs, for every
    supported locale.

 -- amnesia <amnesia@boum.org>  Sun, 26 Sep 2010 11:06:50 +0200

tails (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * The project has merged efforts with Incognito.
    It is now to be called "The (Amnesic) Incognito Live System".
    In short: T(A)ILS.

  * Community
  - Created the amnesia-news mailing-list.
  - Added a forum to the website.
  - Created a chatroom on IRC: #tails on irc.oftc.net

  * Fixed bugs
  - Workaround nasty NetworkManager vs. Tor bug that often
    prevented the system to connect to the Tor network: restart Tor and Vidalia
    when a network interface goes up.
  - onBoard now autodetects the keyboard layout... at least once some
    keys have been pressed.
  - New windows don't open in background anymore, thanks to
    a patched Metacity.
  - Memory wiping at shutdown is now lightning fast, and does not prevent
    the computer to halt anymore.
  - GNOME panel icons are right-aligned again.
  - Fixed permissions on APT config files.
  - Repaired mouse integration when running inside VirtualBox.

  * Iceweasel
  - Torbutton: redirect to Scroogle when presented a Google captcha.
  - Revamped bookmarks
      . moved T(A)ILS own website to the personal toolbar
      . moved webmail links (that are expected to be more than 3 soon)
        to a dedicated folder.
  - Don't show AdBlock Plus icon in the toolbar.
  - Adblock Plus: updated patterns, configured to only update subscriptions
    once a year. Which means never, hopefully, as users do update their
    Live system on a regular basis, don't they?

  * Vidalia: rebased our custom package against 0.2.8.
  
  * Claws Mail
  - Install Claws Mail from backports.org to use the X.509 CA
    certificates provided by Debian.
  - Enable PGP modules with basic configuration:
      . Automatically check signatures.
      . Use gpg-agent to manage passwords.
      . Display warning on start-up if GnuPG doesn't work.
  - Set the IO timeout to 120s (i.e. the double of the default 60s).
  
  * Pidgin
  - Automatically connect to irc.oftc.net with a randomized nickname,
    so as not to advertize the use of T(A)ILS; this nickname is made of:
     . a random firstname picked from the 2000 most registered by the U.S.
       social security administration in the 70s;
     . two random digits.
    Good old irc.indymedia.org is still configured - with same nickname -
    but is not enabled by default anymore.
  - Disabled MSN support, that is far too often affected by security flaws.

  * Build $HOME programmatically
  - Migrated all GConf settings, including the GNOME panel configuration,
    to XML files that are loaded at boot time.
  - Configure iceweasel profile skeleton in /etc/iceweasel.
    A brand new profile is setup from this skeleton once iceweasel is
    started after boot.
      . build sqlite files at build time from plain SQL.
      . FireGPG: hard-code current firegpg version at build time to prevent
        the extension to think it was just updated.
      . stop shipping binary NSS files. These were here only to
        install CaCert's certificate, that is actually shipped by Debian's
        patched libnss.
  
  * Build system
  - Updated Debian Live snapshots APT repository URL.
  - Purge all devel packages at the end of the chroot configuration.
  - Make sure the hook that fixes permissions runs last.
  - Remove unwanted Iceweasel search plugins at build time.
  
  * Misc
  - Added a progress bar for boot time file readahead.
  - Readahead more (~37MB) stuff in foreground at boot time.
  - Make the APT pinning persist in the Live image.
  - localepurge: keep locales for all supported languages,
    don't bother when installing new packages.
  - Removed syslinux help menu: these help pages are either buggy or
    not understandable by non-geeks.
  - Fixed Windows autorun.
  - Disable a few live-initramfs scripts to improve boot time.
  - Firewall: forbid any IPv6 communication with the outside.
  - Virtualization support: install open-vm-tools.
  - WhisperBack: updated to 1.2.1, add a random bug ID to the sent
    mail subject.
  - Prompt for CD removal on shutdown, not for USB device.

  * live-initramfs: new package built from our Git (e2890a04ff) repository.
  - Merged upstream changes up to 1.177.2-1.
  - New noprompt=usb feature.

    wireless adapter, found particularly in the ASUS EeePC model 901
    and above.
  - Build broadcom-sta-source wifi modules.
  - Bugfix: cpufreq modules were not properly added to /etc/modules.
  - Use 800x600 mode on boot rather than 1024x768 for compatibility
    with smaller displays.

amnesia (0.4.2) unstable; urgency=low

  New release, mainly aimed at fixing live-initramfs security issue
  (Debian bug #568750), with an additional set of small enhancements as
  a bonus.

  * live-initramfs: new custom package built from our own live-initramfs
    Git repository (commit 8b96e5a6cf8abc)
  - based on new 1.173.1-1 upstream release
  - fixed live-media=removable behaviour so that filesystem images found
    on non-removable storage are really never used (Debian bug #568750)

  * Vidalia: bring back our UI customizations (0.2.7-1~lenny+amnesia1)

  * APT: consistently use the GeoIP-powered cdn.debian.net

  * Software: make room so that {alpha, future} Squeeze images fit on
    700MB CD-ROM
  - only install OpenOffice.org's calc, draw, impress, math and writer
    components
  - removed OpenOffice.org's English hyphenation and thesaurus
  - removed hunspell, wonder why it was ever added

  * Boot
  - explicitly disable persistence, better safe than sorry
  - removed compulsory 15s timeout, live-initramfs knows how to wait for
    the Live media to be ready

  * Build system: don't cache rootfs anymore

 -- amnesia <amnesia@boum.org>  Sun, 07 Feb 2010 18:28:16 +0100

amnesia (0.4.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Brown paper bag bugfix release: have amnesia-security-check use
    entries publication time, rather than update time... else tagging
    a security issue as fixed, after releasing a new version, make this
    issue be announced to every user of this new, fixed version.

 -- amnesia <amnesia@boum.org>  Sat, 06 Feb 2010 03:58:41 +0100

amnesia (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * We now only build and ship "Hybrid" ISO images, which can be either
    burnt on CD-ROM or dd'd to a USB stick or hard disk.

  * l10n: we now build and ship multilingual images; initially supported
    (or rather wanna-be-supported) languages are: ar, zh, de, en, fr, it,
    pt, es
  - install Iceweasel's and OpenOffice.org's l10n packages for every
    supported language
  - stop installing localized help for OpenOffice.org, we can't afford it
    for enough languages
  - when possible, Iceweasel's homepage and default search engine are localized
  - added Iceweasel's "any language" Scroogle SSL search engine
  - when the documentation icon is clicked, display the local wiki in
    currently used language, if available
  - the Nautilus wipe script is now translatable
  - added gnome-keyboard-applet to the Gnome panel

  * software
  - replaced Icedove with claws mail, in a bit rough way; see
    https://amnesia.boum.org/todo/replace_icedove_with_claws/ for best
    practices and configuration advices
  - virtual keyboard: install onBoard instead of kvkbd
  - Tor controller: install Vidalia instead of TorK
  - install only chosen parts of Gnome, rather than gnome-desktop-environment
  - do not install xdialog, which is unused and not in Squeeze
  - stop installing grub as it breaks Squeeze builds (see Debian bug #467620)
  - install live-helper from snapshots repository into the Live image

  * Iceweasel
  - do not install the NoScript extension anymore: it is not strictly
    necessary but bloodily annoying

  * Provide WhisperBack 1.2 for anonymous, GnuPG-encrypted bug reporting.
  - added dependency on python-gnutls
  - install the SMTP hidden relay's certificate

  * amnesia-security-check: new program that tells users that the amnesia
    version they are running is affected by security flaws, and which ones
    they are; this program is run at Gnome session startup, after sleeping
    2 minutes to let Tor a chance to initialize.
    Technical details:
  - Perl
  - uses the Desktop Notifications framework
  - fetches the security atom feed from the wiki
  - verifies the server certificate against its known CA
  - tries fetching the localized feed; if it fails, fetch the default
    (English) feed

  * live-initramfs: new custom package built from our own live-initramfs
    Git repository (commit 40e957c4b89099e06421)
  - at shutdown time, ask the user to unplug the CD / USB stick, then run
    smem, wait for it to finish, then attempt to immediately halt

  * build system
  - bumped dependency on live-helper to >= 2.0a6 and adapted our config
  - generate hybrid ISO images by default, when installed syslinux is
    recent enough
  - stop trying to support building several images in a row, it is still
    broken and less needed now that we ship hybrid ISO images
  - scripts/config: specify distribution when initializing defaults
  - updated Debian Live APT repository's signing key

  * PowerPC
  - disable virtualbox packages installing and module building on !i386
    && !amd64, as PowerPC is not a supported guest architecture
  - built and imported tor_0.2.1.20-1~~lenny+1_powerpc.deb

  * Squeeze
  - rough beginnings of a scratch Squeeze branch, currently unsupported
  - install gobby-infinote

  * misc
  - updated GnuPG key with up-to-date signatures
  - more improvements on boot time from CD
  - enhanced the wipe in Nautilus UI (now asks for confirmation and
    reports success or failure)
  - removed the "restart Tor" launcher from the Gnome panel

 -- amnesia <amnesia@boum.org>  Fri, 05 Feb 2010 22:28:04 +0100

  - ntfsprogs
  - randomsound to enhance the kernel's random pool
  * Tor
  - install the latest stable release from deb.torproject.org
  - ifupdown script now uses SIGHUP signal rather than a whole tor
    restart, so that in the middle of it vidalia won't start it's own
    tor
  - configure Gnome proxy to use Tor
  * iceweasel
  - adblockplus: upgraded to 1.0.2
  - adblockplus: subscribe to US and DE EasyList extensions, updated patterns
  - firegpg is now installed from Debian Squeeze rather than manually; current
    version is then 0.7.10
  - firegpg: use better keyserver ... namely pool.sks-keyservers.net
  - added bookmark to Amnesia's own website
  - use a custom "amnesiabranding" extension to localize the default search
    engine and homepage depending on the current locale
  - updated noscript whitelist
  - disable overriden homepage redirect on iceweasel upgrade
  * pidgin
  - nicer default configuration with verified irc.indymedia.org's SSL cert
  - do not parse incoming messages for formatting
  - hide formatting toolbar
  * hardware compatibility
  - b43-fwcutter
  - beginning of support for the ppc architecture
  - load acpi-cpufreq, cpufreq_ondemand and cpufreq_powersave kernel
    modules
  * live-initramfs: custom, updated package based on upstream's 1.157.4-1, built
    from commit b0a4265f9f30bad945da of amnesia's custom live-initramfs Git
    repository
  - securely erases RAM on shutdown using smem
  - fixes the noprompt bug when running from USB

  - adapt for live-helper 2.0, and depend on it
  - get amnesia version from debian/changelog
  - include the full version in ISO volume name
  - save .list, .packages and .buildlog
  - scripts/clean: cleanup any created dir in binary_local-includes
  - updated Debian Live snapshot packages repository URL and signing key
  - remove duplicated apt/preferences file, the live-helper bug has been
    fixed
  * l10n: beginning of support for --language=en
  * misc
  - improved boot time on CD by ordering files in the squashfs in the order they
    are used during boot
  - added a amnesia-version script to built images, that outputs the current
    image's version
  - added a amnesia-debug script that prepares a tarball with information that
    could be useful for developpers
  - updated Amnesia GnuPG key to a new 4096R one
  - set time with NTP when a network interface is brought up
  - import amnesia's GnuPG pubkey into the live session user's keyring
  - do not ask DHCP for a specific hostname
  - install localepurge, only keep en, fr, de and es locales, which reduces the
    generated images' size by 100MB
  - added a hook to replace /sbin/swapon with a script that only runs
    /bin/true
  - moved networking hooks responsibility from ifupdown to NetworkManager

amnesia (0.1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Forked Privatix 9.03.15, by Markus Mandalka:
  http://mandalka.name/privatix/index.html.en
  Everything has since been rewritten or so heavily changed that nothing
  remains from the original code... apart of a bunch of Gnome settings.
  * hardware support:
  - install a bunch of non-free wifi firmwares
  - install xsane and add the live user to the scanner group
  - install aircrack-ng
  - install xserver-xorg-video-geode on i386 (eCafe support)
  - install xserver-xorg-video-all
  - install firmware-linux from backports.org
  - install system-config-printer
  - added instructions in README.eCAFE to support the Hercules eCAFE EC-800
    netbook
  * APT:
  - configure pinning to support installing chosen packages from
    squeeze; the APT source for testing is hardcoded in chroot_sources/,
    since there is no way to use $LH_CHROOT_MIRROR in chroot_local-hooks
  - give backports.org priority 200, so that we track upgrades of packages
    installed from there
  * release: include the Changelog and TODO in the generated images,
  in the   /usr/share/doc/amnesia/ directory
  * software: install gnomebaker when building Gnome-based live OS, to
  easily clone myself when running from CD
  * build system
  - build i386 images when the build host is amd64
  - added a version file: /etc/amnesia/version
  - use snapshot live-* packages inside the images
  - setup timezone depending on the chosen build locale
  - rely on standard live-initramfs adduser to do our user setup
    (including sudo vs. Gnome/KDE, etc.)
  - stop "supporting" KDE
  - allow building several images at once
  - migrated most of lh_config invocations to scripts/config
  - append "noprompt" so that halting/rebooting work with splashy
  - moved our own variables to config/amnesia, using the namespace
    $AMNESIA_*
  * iceweasel
  - default search engine is now Scroogle SSL, configured to search pages
    in French language; the English one is also installed
  - never ask to save passwords or forms content
  - configured the torbutton extension to use polipo
  - installed the CACert root certificate
  - installed the SSL Blacklist extension and the blacklist data
  - installed the FireGPG extension
  - installed the CS Lite extension
  - installed the NoScript extension
  - NoScript, CS Lite: replaced the default whitelists with a list of
    trusted, non-commercial Internet Service Providers
  - configure extensions (add to prefs.js):
    user_pref("extensions.torbutton.startup", true);
    user_pref("extensions.torbutton.startup_state", 1);
    user_pref("extensions.torbutton.tor_enabled", true);
    user_pref("noscript.notify.hide", true);
    user_pref("capability.policy.maonoscript.sites", "about:
      about:blank about:certerror about:config about:credits
      about:neterror about:plugins about:privatebrowsing
      about:sessionrestore chrome: resource:");
    user_pref("extensions.firegpg.no_updates", true);
  - install the NoScript plugin from Debian squeeze
  - delete urlclassifier3.sqlite on $HOME refresh: as we disabled
    "safebrowsing", this huge file is of no use
  - torbutton: install newer version from Squeeze
  * linux: removed non-686 kernel flavours when building i386 images
  * compatibility: append "live-media=removable live-media-timeout=15", to
    prevent blindly booting another debian-live installed on the hard disk
  * software: added
  - gnome-app-install
  - iwconfig
  - cryptkeeper: Gnome system tray applet to encrypt files with EncFS
  - kvkbd: virtual keyboard (installed from backports.org)
  - sshfs (and added live user to the fuse group)
  - less, secure-delete, wipe, seahorse, sshfs, ntfs-3g
  - scribus
  * Tor
  - enable the transparent proxy, the DNS resolver, and the control port
  - save authentication cookie to /tmp/control_auth_cookie, so that the
    live user can use Tork and co.
  - autostart Tork with Gnome
  - Tork: installed, disabled most notifications and startup tips
  - added a restart tor hook to if-up.d (used by Network Manager as well),
    so that Tor does work immediately even if the network cable was
    plugged late in/after the boot process
  * $HOME
  - added a nautilus-script to wipe files and directories
  - bash with working completion for the live user
  * polipo: install and configure this HTTP proxy to forward requests
  through Tor
  * DNS: install and configure pdnsd to forward any DNS request through
  the Tor resolver
  * firewall: force every outgoing TCP connection through the Tor
  transparent proxy, discard any outgoing UDP connection
  * misc
  - set syslinux timeout to 4 seconds
  - use splashy for more user-friendly boot/halt sequences
