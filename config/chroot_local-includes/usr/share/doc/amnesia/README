Building an image
=================

Customization
-------------

The settings that can be customized can be found in `config/amnesia`;
e.g. images types to build, desktop environment.

You'd better never directly edit this file: rather put your custom
variable assignments in a new `config/amnesia.local` file. The values
found in the `.local` file will override the ones from the
upstream one.

These configuration files are actually shell scripts, and are sourced
by various other scripts.

How to build
------------

All following commands must be run as `root`, at the root of the
source directory: a Git checkout, an extracted tarball.

Initialize the Live system's configuration with `lh_config`:

	lh_config

Optionally set your preferred language for the generated images; only
"fr" is currently fully supported, but other languages are still worth
trying:

	lh_config --language fr

You can then use the standard live-helper commands to build the chosen
images (`lh build`) and to cleanup the build directory (`lh clean`).

Updating the live user's $HOME directory
----------------------------------------

This is the `home-refresh` script's job. Read the documentation at the
top of it.
