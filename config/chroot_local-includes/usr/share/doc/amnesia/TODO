install/upgrade
===============

misc.
-----

- clone the source directory to /usr/local/src/, and allow easy
  remastering from the live system itself?
- steal Privatix's starter-cd trick for computers that do not boot on USB

documentation
=============

* link to and/or copy and adapt documentation from:
  - Incognito
  - Privatix
* document how to install/upgrade

iceweasel
=========

- what would be the advantages to put the configuration into a default
  profile in `/etc` rather than `$HOME`?

usecases
========

switch between use cases in syslinux menu

* persistence:
  - with read-write access to update persistent files
  - with read-only access to **only** *use* persistent files without
    leaving any new trace
* Tor enforcement

steal some Incognito tricks
===========================

- look at `fsscript.sh` (Tor auth cookie, Tork user config, etc.)
- smem

Misc.
=====

- fix TorK iconify on startup
- is `allow-user-other` necessary for sshfs? (`/etc/fuse.conf`)
- install seahorse-plugins (e.g. for Gedit) which is not in Lenny
- `AutomapHostsOnResolve 1` may trigger desynchronization between the
  cache and automatically mapped addresses, in case Tor is restarted
  => empty pdnsd's cache when Tor is restarted (Gnome panel launcher,
  `if-up.d` hook)
- try Vidalia, which is now in Debian
- desktop/iceweasel themes that mimic Windows/IE?
   - <http://ubuntu.online02.com/node/14>
- set time with NTP?
- virtualization support (kvm, qemu, VMWare, VirtualBox); see
  Incognito tricks, virtualbox hook bundled with debian live + patch
  on the ML
- VoIP: Incognito now includes Twinkle, that supports for SIP, ZRTP
  and SRTP
- customization:
  <http://www.offensive-security.com/blog/backtrack/customising-backtrack-live-cd-the-easy-way/>
- the shutdown splash screen hides the "you can halt" prompt
- rename torrent directories from -iso to -cd
- install
  [randomsound](http://www.digital-scurf.org/software/randomsound)
  ([in Lenny](http://packages.debian.org/lenny/randomsound)) if it
  does not bring in too many dependencies; is `alsa-utils`
  already installed?
- install an implementation of
  [Shamir's Secret Sharing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing),
  such as [ssss](http://point-at-infinity.org/ssss/) or
  [gfshare](https://launchpad.net/libgfshare)

wiki
====

static
------

* use ikiwiki's mirrorlist plugin to add links to the online wiki from
  the static one included in the images; **but** it generates wrong
  links when the `usedirs` settings are not the same on the mirror as
  on the static copy
* fix the build locale

online
------

* move this TODO to the wiki
* use the po plugin for translation

Have a look to...
