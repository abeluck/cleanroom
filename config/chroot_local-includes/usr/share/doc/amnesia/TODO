install/upgrade
===============

specification
-------------

- allow adding 2nd encrypted data partition, or at least leave room
  for it
- USB: allow non-destructively upgrading the live system only, not
  touching the other partitions (use the iso + grub trick ? tar image
  + cp?)

from CD to USB
--------------

* use grml's
  [patches to live-initramfs](http://git.grml.org/?p=live-initramfs-grml.git;a=tree;f=debian/patches) 
  to support directly booting an ISO image
* Incognito's `root_overlay/usr/sbin/create-usb` seems quite nice, as
  it allows using an existing fat32 partition, but it does not
  proposes to partition the USB device first.
* Ubuntu's [usb-creator](FIXME)
   - supposed to replicate exactly the CD to USB
   - does not seem to recognize non-Ubuntu CDs (0.1.16 crashes on
     Lenny, 0.1.10 does not display them in the GUI even if it the
     console output proves that it takes good note of their presence )
   - how does it handle partitions?
   - [launchpad](https://launchpad.net/usb-creator)
* [UNetbootin](http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/)
   - works on Windows and GNU/Linux
   - has a plugin architecture in case we need new or custom features
   - included in squeeze and sid, easily backported to Lenny
   - works like a charm to install an ISO image to USB, but the
     syslinux menu has the unetbootin logo instead of Debian's one
   - non-destructive install: does not format the chosen partition
   - **TRY ME**: from a running Live CD to USB? (seems to need to dd
     the CD to an ISO file first, which uses a lot of memory)
   - **TRY ME**: .img image to USB?
* [Ubuntu LiveUSB](http://klik.atekon.de/liveusb/)
   - (a bit too) simplistic
   - dedicated to "create a bootable Live USB medium from a running
     Ubuntu Live CD"
   - depending on sources, it partitions USB stick with one single
     800MB partition or one partition using the whole device; in any
     case, it unconditionally overwrites the device's content
   - able to upgrade without re-partitioning the device?
   - [launchpad](https://launchpad.net/liveusb)
* sidux's `install-sidux-usb-gui` needs an input ISO, but it still
  deserves being looked at more thoroughly; see the
  [manual](http://manual.sidux.com/en/hd-install-opts-en.htm#usb-hd).
* Fedora's `livecd-iso-to-disk`:
   - [manual](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FedoraLiveCD/USBHowTo)
* Fedora's [liveusb-creator](https://fedorahosted.org/liveusb-creator/):
   - works on Windows and GNU/Linux
   - "non-destructive install", which means?
   - sidux ships a modified version:
     which does not work on Lenny due to `dosfslabel` exiting with
     error code 1 even when successful
      - [.deb](http://sidux.office-vienna.at/sidux/debian/pool/main/l/liveusb-creator/),
      - [source](http://w3you.com/liveusb-creator/liveusb-creator.htm)
   - needs an ISO file, does not know how to read a real CD

from USB to CD
--------------

misc.
-----

- clone the source directory to /usr/local/src/, and allow easy
  remastering from the live system itself?
- steal Privatix's starter-cd trick for computers that do not boot on USB

documentation
=============

* link to and/or copy and adapt documentation from:
  - Incognito
  - Privatix
* document how to install/upgrade

iceweasel
=========

- install the SSL certificates for some servers amongst those who signed the
  [data retention manifest](http://www.nadir.org/nadir/aktuell/2008/10/10/36282.html)
- add bookmarks to the above-mentioned servers?
- easily build a live system with a custom JavaScript/cookies
  whitelist
- install various Scroogle SSL search engines for other
  to-be-supported languages (e.g. `de`)
- what would be the advantages to put the configuration into a default
  profile in `/etc` rather than `$HOME`?

switch to Debian-packaged extensions
------------------------------------

- CS Lite: is another nice cookie manager already packaged?

Pidgin
======

- install and enable `pidgin-libnotify`?

security
--------

- add an option to pidgin-otr to only allow OTR protocol v2 and later,
  to circumvent the protocol version negotiation attack described in
  [Finite-State Security Analysis of OTR Version 2](http://www.jbonneau.com/OTR_analysis.pdf)
  ... until the protocol + libotr themselves are fixed
- ask on otr-dev why the protocol hasn't been updated since the
  publication of the aforementioned paper, especially wrt.
  the protocol version attack

usecases
========

switch between use cases in syslinux menu

* persistence:
  - with read-write access to update persistent files
  - with read-only access to **only** *use* persistent files without
    leaving any new trace
* Tor enforcement

steal some Incognito tricks
===========================

- look at `fsscript.sh` (Tor auth cookie, Tork user config, etc.)
- smem

Misc.
=====

- fix TorK iconify on startup
- is `allow-user-other` necessary for sshfs? (`/etc/fuse.conf`)
- install seahorse-plugins (e.g. for Gedit) which is not in Lenny
- `AutomapHostsOnResolve 1` may trigger desynchronization between the
  cache and automatically mapped addresses, in case Tor is restarted
  => empty pdnsd's cache when Tor is restarted (Gnome panel launcher,
  `if-up.d` hook)
- try Vidalia, which is now in Debian
- desktop/iceweasel themes that mimic Windows/IE?
   - <http://ubuntu.online02.com/node/14>
- set time with NTP?
- virtualization support (kvm, qemu, VMWare, VirtualBox); see
  Incognito tricks, virtualbox hook bundled with debian live + patch
  on the ML
- VoIP: Incognito now includes Twinkle, that supports for SIP, ZRTP
  and SRTP
- customization:
  <http://www.offensive-security.com/blog/backtrack/customising-backtrack-live-cd-the-easy-way/>
- the shutdown splash screen hides the "you can halt" prompt
- rename torrent directories from -iso to -cd
- install
  [randomsound](http://www.digital-scurf.org/software/randomsound)
  ([in Lenny](http://packages.debian.org/lenny/randomsound)) if it
  does not bring in too many dependencies; is `alsa-utils`
  already installed?
- install an implementation of
  [Shamir's Secret Sharing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing),
  such as [ssss](http://point-at-infinity.org/ssss/) or
  [gfshare](https://launchpad.net/libgfshare)

wiki
====

static
------

* use ikiwiki's mirrorlist plugin to add links to the online wiki from
  the static one included in the images; **but** it generates wrong
  links when the `usedirs` settings are not the same on the mirror as
  on the static copy
* fix the build locale

online
------

* move this TODO to the wiki
* use the po plugin for translation

Have a look to...
