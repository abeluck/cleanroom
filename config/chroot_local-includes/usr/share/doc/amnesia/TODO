release
=======

- add copyright notice
- generate Changelog from Git history
- setup Git repository
- setup web site
- generate a GnuPG keypair for amnesia@boum.org
- GnuPG-sign the Git tags and generated images

build system
============

hardware support
================

PowerPC
-------

- http://machine-cycle.blogspot.com/2009/05/running-debian-on-qemu-powerpc.html
- /usr/share/doc/qemu/README.Debian
- http://mac-on-linux.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/mac-on-linux/trunk/mollib/drivers/

install/upgrade
===============

- install on (optionally encrypted) USB from CD
- install on CD from USB?
- clone the source directory to /usr/local/src/, and allow easy
  remastering from the live system itself?
- add 2nd encrypted data partition
- USB: allow upgrading only the live system, not touching the other
  partitions (use the iso + grub trick ? tar image + cp?)

documentation
=============

- copy and adapt the privatix documentation
- write documentation for install/upgrade

iceweasel
=========

- install some trusted, non-commercial SSL certificates (e.g.
  Autistici/Inventati)
- easily build a live system with a custom JavaScript/cookies
  whitelist

profile directory cleanup
-------------------------

[documentation](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_folder_-_Firefox#Files_and_folders_in_the_profile)

* `cert8.db`: could be generated from scratch by adding our few custom
  SSL root certificates with `certutil`
* `secmod.db`: seems like there is only standard content here, what
  happens if this file is deleted?
* `key3.db`: if missing, the other `*.db` files can't be used

switch to Debian-packaged extensions
------------------------------------

- CS Lite: is another nice cookie manager already packaged?
- SSL Blacklist: serious licensing problem, see thread on
  pkg-mozext-maintainers@lists.alioth.debian.org, could be solved

Pidgin
======

- base config?
- add irc.indymedia.org + SSL certificate check

usecases
========

switch between use cases in syslinux menu
- Tor enforcement
- persistence

steal some Incognito tricks
===========================

- look at `fsscript.sh` (Tor auth cookie, Tork user config, etc.)
- smem
- macchanger

build $HOME in a programmatic way
=================================

iceweasel
---------

### sqlite

Most sqlite files could be built from scratch with SQL commands.

Bookmarks are the only pieces of data we want to preserve in
`places.sqlite`; according to
[MozillaZine](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Places.sqlite), a missing
`places.sqlite` is rebuilt using the latest dated JSON file from the
`bookmarkbackups` folder. We could then store our bookmarks data as
a backup, and rm+exclude `places.sqlite`.

Gnome
-----

### panel

- use `gconftool --load`
- see `/usr/share/gconf/defaults/05_panel-default-setup.entries`

$HOME cleanup
=============

- cleanup `.config/xfce*`
- is `.purple/prefs.xml` different from the one that would be
  automatically generated?

Misc.
=====

- fix TorK iconify on startup
- is `allow-user-other` necessary for sshfs? (`/etc/fuse.conf`)
- install seahorse-plugins (e.g. for Gedit) which is not in Lenny
- test XFCE images and update XFCE config
- `AutomapHostsOnResolve 1` may trigger desynchronization between the
  cache and automatically mapped addresses, in case Tor is restarted
  => empty pdnsd's cache when Tor is restarted (Gnome panel launcher,
  `if-up.d` hook)
- try Vidalia, which is now in Debian
