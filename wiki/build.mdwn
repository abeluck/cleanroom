One may want to [[customize]] her image before building.

Every following command must be run as `root`, at the root of the
source directory one has [[downloaded|download]] : a [[git]] checkout,
an extracted tarball, whatever.

Initialize the Live system's configuration with `lh_config`:

	lh_config

Optionally set your preferred language for the generated images; only
"fr" is currently fully supported, but other languages are still worth
trying:

	lh_config --language fr

You can then use the standard live-helper commands to build the chosen
images (`lh build`) and to cleanup the build directory (`lh clean`).
