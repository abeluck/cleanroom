Feel free to post your ideas for todo and [[wishlist]] items here, as well
as any [[patches|patch]]. If it seems more like a bug in the existing code,
post it to [[bugs]] instead. Link items to [[todo/done]] when done.

Our good old
[TODO](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=blob;f=config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/doc/amnesia/TODO)
file still has to be imported into this wiki.
