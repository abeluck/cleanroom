"shares many fundamentals with that of Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and most "
"other modern operating systems, so if you have used any of them, getting "
"used to GNOME will take no time. As this document is not intended as a "
"complete guide for GNOME there are only a few things about it that we will "
