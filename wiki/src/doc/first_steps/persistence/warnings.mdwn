[[!meta title="Warnings About the Persistent Storage"]]

[[!toc levels=1]]

Storing Sensitive Documents
===========================

**The persistent storage is not hidden.** An attacker in possession of the USB
stick can know that there is a persistent storage on it. Take into consideration
that you can be forced or tricked to give out its passphrase.

Note also that **secure deletion do not work as expected on USB sticks.**<br/>
[[See the corresponding documentation.|encryption_and_privacy/secure_deletion#index2h1]]

Overwriting Configurations
==========================

The persistent storage allows you to overwrite the configuration of the programs
included in Tails. Those programs are carefully configured with security in mind.
Overwriting the default configuration can break this security or render them unusuable.

Furthermore, the anonymity of Tor and Tails relies on making it harder to
distinguish one Tails user from another. <strong>Changing the default
configurations can break your anonymity.</strong>

Installing New Software
=======================

The programs included in Tails are selected with care and audited for their
security. This may not be the case of all the packages available in Debian.
**Other programs than the ones included in Tails may be subject to security
holes that Tails cannot protect you from.**

Browser Plugins
===============

The web browser is a central part in a system like Tails. The plugins included
in the browser are carefully chosen and configured with security in mind. **If
you install other plugins or change their configuration, you can break your
anonymity.**

Use to the Minimum
==================

**Use the persistent storage only when necessary and to the minimum.** It is
always possible to start Tails without activating the persistent storage. All the
features of the persistent storage are optional and need to be explicitly
activated. Only the files that you specify are stored.
