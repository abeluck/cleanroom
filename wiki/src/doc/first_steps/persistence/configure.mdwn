Start the persistent storage assistant
======================================

To start the persistent storage assistant, choose
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guisubmenu">Tails</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">Configure persistent storage</span></span>.

<!--
FIXME-0.11: Error, Persistence partition is not unlocked.
-->

Creating the persistent storage
===============================

When run for the first time, or after [[deleting the persistent
storage|delete]], the assistant proposes to create a new persistent storage on
the USB stick from which Tails is running.

1. The persistent storage is an encrypted volume protected by a passphrase.
Specify a passphrase of your choice in both the
<span class="guilabel">Passphrase</span> and <span class="guilabel">Verify
Passphrase</span> text boxes.

2. Click on the <span class="guilabel">Create</span> button.

3. Wait for the creation to finish.

<div class="bug">

<strong>If the creation is interrupted before it finishes</strong>, you may not
be able to start Tails from the USB stick any more. This can happen if you
close the window of the wizard or unplug the USB stick during the creation of
the persistent storage. [[Erase|first_steps/resetting_a_usb_stick]] and
[[reinstall|first_steps/usb_installer]] Tails to fix this issue.

Persistent Storage Features
