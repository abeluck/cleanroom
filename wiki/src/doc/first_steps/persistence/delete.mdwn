[[!meta title="Delete the Persistent Storage"]]

To delete the persistent storage of a USB stick, choose 
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guisubmenu">Tails</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">Delete persistent storage</span></span>, and click
  on the <span class="guilabel">Delete</span> button.

This can be useful in order to delete all the files saved to the persistent
storage in a single operation. You can later create a new persistent storage on
the same USB stick without having to reinstall Tails.

<div class="caution">
<strong>This technique may not prevent an attacker to recover the files of the
old persistent storage using [[data
recovery techniques|encryption_and_privacy/secure_deletion#index1h1]].</strong>
For more security, you can do the following operations on the USB stick:

<ol>
<li>[[Erase Tails|resetting_a_usb_stick]]</li>
<li>[[Securely clean all the available disk space|encryption_and_privacy/secure_deletion#index4h1]]</li>
<li>[[Reinstall Tails|usb_installer]]</li>
<li>[[Create a new persistent storage|persistence/configure]]</li>
</ol>
</div>
