[[!meta title="Delete the Persistent Storage"]]

[[!inline pages="doc/first_steps/persistence.caution" raw="yes"]]

To delete the persistent storage of a USB stick, choose 
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guisubmenu">Tails</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">Delete persistent storage</span></span>, and click
  on the <span class="guilabel">Delete</span> button.

This can be useful in order to delete all the files saved to the persistent
storage in a single operation. You can later create a new persistent storage on
the same USB stick without having to reinstall Tails.

Creating a new persistent storage on top of an old one makes it hard for an
attacker to recover the files of the old persistent storage using [[data
recovery techniques|encryption_and_privacy/secure_deletion#index1h1]]. But for
more security, you can do the following operations on the USB stick:

1. [[Erase Tails|resetting_a_usb_stick]]
2. [[Securely clean all the available disk space|encryption_and_privacy/secure_deletion#index4h1]]
3. [[Reinstall Tails|usb_installer]]
4. [[Create a new persistent storage|persistence/configure]]
