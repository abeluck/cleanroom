To erase Tails from a USB stick, and use it for something else, you have to
reset it.

**The content of the USB stick will be lost in the operation,** but an attacker
might still be able to tell that Tails was installed on the USB stick using
[[data recovery techniques|encryption_and_privacy/secure_deletion]].

If at some point you are not sure about the device name it is recommended to
stop proceeding otherwise **you might risk overwriting any hard drive on the
system**.
