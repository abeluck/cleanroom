[[!meta title="Introduction to GNOME and the Tails desktop"]]

The graphical user interface used in Tails is called [GNOME](gnome.org) and
shares many fundamentals with that of Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and
most other modern operating systems, so if you have used any of them,
getting used to GNOME will take no time. As this document is not
intended as a complete guide for GNOME there are only a few things about
it that we will mention here to spare you some time.

**FIXME**: Upgrade the screenshot

First of all, in the upper left corner of the screen there is a button
with a logo in it, followed by three menus: *Applications*,
*Places* and *System*.

The *Applications* menu is where you will find short cuts to the
installed applications. Please explore the different categories of
applications and try out those that seem interesting.

The *Places* menu is here to make it easy to access storage media.

The *System* menu allows to:

* customize some aspects of the GNOME desktop (*Preferences*);
* change some important aspects of the system and hardware behavior
  (*Administration*);
* shutdown the computer.

On the right of these three menu entries, a few shortcuts allow to
launch the most frequently used applications. Passing the mouse cursor
over one of these shortcut will display the application name and its
function.

In the upper right corner you will find a couple of icons, each of which
offers an interface for some running applicationÂ : the onion icon is
made to control Tor using Vidalia, the two computer screens are for the
network settings using NetworkManager. They will be explained more in
details in [[anonymous_internet]]. Other icons help you
keep an eye on the battery level if you
run from a laptop, one allows to instantly change the keyboard layout,
another controls the sound level. Note that the clock icon allows to
change the current timezone to make it show the local time.

You are encouraged to check these icons out with the left and right
mouse buttons, but we will say more about some of them later on in
this article.

On the bottom of the screen is another panel: on its left, an icon
allows to minimize all open windows to show the Desktop; then come the
buttons for open windows; on the right, a set of four similar
rectangle icons gives access to four different workspaces.

Clicking on the icon at the bottom left you will access the Desktop. A
*Computer* icon provides access to storage media; the *amnesia's Home*
is a shortcut to the default folder where most applications save files;
then comes the shortcut to this documentation, and another allows to
report a bug in Tails to its developers; to end with, the *Trash* is the
place where "deleted" files are moved.

## <a name="nautilus"></a>Managing files with Nautilus

Nautilus is GNOME's file manager, (S)FTP client and more and it looks like this
while in file managing mode:

To manage local files, follow links on the desktop or from *Places* menu at top
left corner of the screen. To move files or folders, you can drag them from one
window and drop them to another.

To connect to remote FTP or SFTP server, go to *Connect to Server...* from
*Places* menu.
