"If you live in a country where Tor is blocked, or if you want to try\n"
"to hide the fact that you are using Tor, you may want to use\n"
"[Tor bridges](https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges) (see the link\n"
"for further information about bridges and how to get them). Tails can\n"
"be started in \"bridge mode\" which forces Tor to only connect through\n"
"bridges (it will *never* connect to the Tor network directly). Once\n"
"Tails graphical user interface has started you will be guided to set\n"
"up bridges but you must have obtained the bridge information prior to\n"
"this and have them available (e.g. written down on a piece of paper).  \n"

"This is currently an experimental feature that can be enabled by adding "
"\"bridge\" to the kernel cmdline: when Tails boots, select language in the "
"boot menu but press TAB instead of ENTER. Then write \"bridge\" (without "
"quotes) and press ENTER."
