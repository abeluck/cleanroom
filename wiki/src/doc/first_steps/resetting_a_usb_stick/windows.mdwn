<h2 class="bullet-number-one">Run DiskPart</h2>

<!--
FIXME: How do you get to the command prompt.
-->

Run the `diskpart` command in a command prompt.

<h2 class="bullet-number-two">Find out the disk number of the USB stick</h2>

Unplug the USB stick.

Type the following command to list disks known to DiskPart:

    list disk

DiskPart should display a list of disks and information about them.

Plug back the destination USB stick.

Run the `list disk` command again.

A new disk should have appeared in the list.

Double-check that its properties, such as its size, match the
expectations you have of the USB stick you want to reset, and take
good note of the *number* assigned by DiskPart to this disk.

<h2 class="bullet-number-three">Select the USB stick</h2>

Tell DiskPart you want to operate on the USB stick; this is done using
the select command as follows, replacing `NUMBER` with the disk number
you have taken note of previously:

    select disk=NUMBER

<h2 class="bullet-number-four">Do the actual reset</h2>

Ask DiskPart to remove all partitions from the selected disk:

    clean
