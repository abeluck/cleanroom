[[!meta title="Persistent Storage"]]

If you use Tails, version 0.11 or later, from a USB stick, you can create a
persistent storage in the free space left on the USB stick by the <span
class="application">Tails USB Installer</span>. The files in the persistent
storage are saved and remain available across separate working sessions.

You can use this persistent storage to store different kinds of files:

  - your personal files and working documents
  - the software packages that you download and install in Tails
  - the configuration of the programs you use
  - your encryption keys

The persistent storage is an encrypted volume protected by a passphrase.

Once the persistent storage is created, you can choose to activate it or not
each time you start Tails.
