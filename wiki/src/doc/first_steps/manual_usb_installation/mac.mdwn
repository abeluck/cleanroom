This technique uses the command line.

Some users reported to successfully boot from a USB stick using an Intel Mac
after following those steps:

- First, partition the USB drive in "Apple Partition Map" format from the 'Disk
  Utility' in Tails.
- Then I followed the instruction on [[installing onto a USB stick for
  Linux|linux]].
- You will need to have rEFIt installed on the Mac.
- Hold the 'command/apple' key while booting up and select the USB drive to boot from.

Note that Tails developers are in general not very knowledgeable about Mac. Any
additional information is welcome.
