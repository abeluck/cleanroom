[[!meta title="Installing onto a USB stick"]]

Starting from version 0.11, Tails includes a custom USB installer to create
bootable USB sticks. The advantages of using Tails USB installer are that you
can:

  - **use the extra space** left on the USB stick,
  - **setup a persistent storage** to store some of your settings.

But in order to use the USB installer, you need to start Tails from another
media than the USB you want to install. You can either:

  - **[[Burn a Tails CD|download#index4h1]]** (recommended)
  - **Use another Tails USB**, for example from a friend
  - **[[Manually install Tails onto another USB
    stick|manual_usb_installation]]**, if you can't use a CD
