[[!meta title="Introduction"]]

In this document we try to present The Amnesic Incognito Live
System in an easy to understand and reasonably thorough manner in hope
to give the new user a crash course in what might be a completely new
set of applications and concepts regarding anonymity and security on
the Internet.

It is quite long so you might want to not read it in one go but
instead read the introduction and conclusion, as well as the sections
on only those applications you intend to use with the possibility to
return to it whenever you want to try something new or use it for
reference.

If you have experience with these applications and concepts from
elsewhere and feel comfortable with the user interface in general,
reading this document is maybe not necessary at all. A word of caution
to all users is not to alter the network, proxy and firewall settings
unless you know what you are doing â€“ poking around with them too much
might spoil the built-in defences of Tails.

**FIXME**: here was a section moved to about.mdwn

To use Tails, you simply insert the CD or USB-drive that you have
installed Tails on in a computer and restart it. Tails should
then start as an independent operating system instead of Microsoft
Windows or whatever operating system you have installed. You might
need to select the inserted boot device in the BIOS, or using some
kind of boot menu (try F12).
