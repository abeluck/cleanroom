"IceWeasel is an unbranded version of Mozilla Firefox webbrowser.  Given "
"Mozilla Firefox's popularity many of you have probably used it before. Its "
"user interface is like any other modern web browser, but there are a few "
"things we want to mention, some that are special with this particular "
"installation. Do you remember what we said [earlier](#how) about end-to-end "
"encryption and its importance while using Tor? Here is how it looks in "
"Firefox when you are using a secure, end-to-end encrypted connection:"

"Notice the locks in the status bar and address bar (the latter which also "
"has turned yellowish) and that the address begins with \"http**s**://\" – "
"these are the indicators that a secure connection using "
"[SSL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer) is being used. You "
"should try to only use services that use secure connections when you are "
"required to send sensitive information (like passwords), otherwise its very "
"easy for an eavesdropper to steal whatever information you are sending. In "
"this case what we are trying to do is logging in on an email account at "
"[lavabit](http://lavabit.com/), using their [webmail "
"interface](https://lavabit.com/apps/webmail/src/login.php). Let us proceed "
"with logging in there so we can see how it is possible to send end-to-end "

"At this stage we are ready to press send. When Bob receives this email he "
"can also use FireGPG to decrypt it in a very similar way – he will just have "
"to select the encrypted message and then use the FireGPG menu to choose "
"\"Verify\" or \"Decrypt\", or both. This can be done with any so-called PGP "
"block. There is one important limitation in FireGPG, though. It cannot "
"generate new keys, so you will have to use another application for that. We "
"recommend using the [GNU Privacy Assistant](#gpa), found under the "
"\"Utilities\" section of the K menu, or [KPGP](#kpgp), found in the "
"\"Utilities -&gt; PIM\" section."

"Returning to web browsing again we need to do something about the problems "
"with JavaScript, cookies and Adobe Flash that you might remember from an "
"earlier section. To deal with these problems we use an extension called "
"[Torbutton](https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/)  which is specifically "
"designed for dealing with them (and other things) for Firefox in combination "
"with Tor. Torbutton can be either switched on or off, indicated by \"Tor "
"enabled\" and \"Tor disabled\" in the Firefox status bar in the bottom right "
"of its window. It should be noted that these labels are a bit misleading for "
"Tails users as Tor cannot be switched off. So, in our case \"Tor enabled\" "
"means that Torbutton will disable a lot of stuff that could harm anonymity, "
"and \"Tor disabled\" simply means that you only get Tor and no additional "
"protection. As such, you should only disable Torbutton for sites that you "
"trust."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"But why would you ever disable Torbutton? Well, while it is enabled some "
"sites might not work as you expect them to since certain features are "
"disabled or will behave differently. For example, the popular video service "
"[youtube](http://www.youtube.com/) will not work properly as you can see "
"here when we are trying to watch [this "
"clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIDxDMwwlsw):"

"In order to get the video player to show up, we will have to disable "

"would disable the use of Tor completely, but as we have mentioned earlier, "
"nothing escapes Tor while running Tails so your connection will still be "
"anonymized. However, you will have to trust that Google (the current owner "
"of youtube) is not doing anything fishy with all their JavaScripts, the "
"Flash-based video player etc. that could break your anonymity."

"otherwise. In order to visit them you will need to disable Torbutton and "
"reload the page in a new tab. Indeed there are a few more oddities related "
"to toggling Torbutton on and off. If a web site does not work as expected "
"after toggling Torbutton you might have to do any of the following to get it "
