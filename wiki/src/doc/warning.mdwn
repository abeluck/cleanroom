[[!meta title="Warning"]]

**FIXME:**

The most important would be to be clear about what Tails doesn't
protect you against :

- Doesn't protect you from a targeted attack against a specific person
  for example in the case of confirmation attacks, if the two ends of
  a connection are analysed, if your connection is being monitored or
  analysed.
- Doesn't protect you against MitM with fake certificates or if you
  don't pay enough attention.
- It makes it clear that you are using Tor and probably Tails. It
  doesn't make you look like any random Internet user.
- Doesn't clear the metadata of your images for you (eg. the serial
  number of your digital camera).
- Doesn't makes your crappy passwords stronger.
- Doesn't magically separte your different virtual identities if used
  in parallel in the same session.
- Doesn't protect you from a global adversary.
