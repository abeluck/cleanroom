Even thought we're doing our best to offer you good tools to protect your
privacy while using a computer, **there is no magic or perfect solution to such
a complex problem**. Understanding well the limits of such tools is a crucial
step in, first, deciding whether Tails is the right tool for you, and second,
helping you making a good use of it.

## Tor exit nodes can eavesdrop on communications

While using Tor, instead of taking a direct route from source to destination,
data packets on the Tor network take a random pathway through several relays
that cover your tracks so no observer at any single point can tell where the
data came from or where it's going.

![A Tor connection usually goes through 3 relays with the last one establishing
the actual connection to the final
destination](htw2-tails.png)

The last relay on this circuit, called the exit node, is the one that
establishes the actual connection to the destination server. As Tor does not,
and by design cannot, encrypt the traffic between an exit node and the
destination server, **any exit node is in a position to capture any traffic
passing through it**. See, [Tor FAQ: Can exit nodes eavesdrop on
communications?](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#CanexitnodeseavesdroponcommunicationsIsntthatbad)

For example, in 2007, a security researcher intercepted thousands of private
e-mail messages sent by foreign embassies and human rights groups around the
world by spying on the connections coming out of an exit node he was running.
See [Wired: Rogue Nodes Turn Tor Anonymizer Into Eavesdropper's
Paradise.](http://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2007/09/embassy_hacks).

**To protect yourself from such attacks you should use end-to-end encryption**
such as TLS, for example by choosing to use HTTPS whenever it's possible.
Fortunately, Tails includes HTTPS Everywhere, a Firefox extension that switches
automatically to HTTPS all your communications to a number of major websites.
See, [EFF: HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere).

## It makes it clear that you are using Tor and probably Tails

**Your IPS or your local network administrator** can easily check that you're
connecting to a Tor relay, and not a normal web server for example.

**The destination server your are contacting through Tor** can know whether your
communication comes out from a Tor exit node by consulting the publicly
available list of exit nodes that might contact it. For example using the [Tor
Bulk Exit List tool](https://check.torproject.org/cgi-bin/TorBulkExitList.py) of
the Tor Project.

**So using Tails doesn't make your look like any random Internet user.**
The anonymity provided by Tor and Tails works by trying to make all of their
users look the same so it's not possible to identify who is who amongst them.

## Man-in-the-middle attacks

A man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) is a form of active eavesdropping in which the
attacker makes independent connections with the victims and relays messages
between them, making them believe that they are talking directly to each other
over a private connection, when in fact the entire conversation is controlled by
the attacker.

Quoted from [Wikipedia: Man-in-the-middle
attack](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)

![Illustration of a man-in-the-middle attack](man_in_the_middle.jpg)

While using Tor, man-in-the-middle attacks can still happen between the exit
node and the destination server. The exit node itself can also act as a
man-in-the-middle, for an example of this see [MW-Blog: TOR exit-node doing MITM
attacks](http://www.teamfurry.com/wordpress/2007/11/20/tor-exit-node-doing-mitm-attacks).

**Again, to protect yourself from such attacks you should use end-to-end
encryption** and while doing so taking extra care at verifying the server
authenticity.

Usually, this is automatically done throught SSL certificates checked by your
browser against a given set of recognized certificate authorities. If you get a
security exception message such as this one you might be victim of a
man-in-the-middle attack and should not bypass it unless you have another
trusted way of checking the certificate's fingerprint with the people running
the service.

![This Connection is Untrusted](ssl_warning.png)

But on top of that the certificate authorities model of trust on Internet is
susceptible to various methods of compromise. For example, in March 15, 2011,
Comodo, one of the major SSL certificates company, reported that a user account
with an affiliate registration authority had been compromised which was used to
create a new user account that issued nine certificate signing requests. Nine
certificates for seven domains were issued: mail.google.com, login.live.com,
www.google.com, login.yahoo.com (three certificates), login.skype.com,
addons.mozilla.org, and global trustee. See [Comodo: The Recent RA
Compromise](http://blogs.comodo.com/it-security/data-security/the-recent-ra-compromise/).

This still leaves open the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack even when
your browser is trusting an HTTPS connection but this won't affect Tor or Tails
users more that anybody else on the Internet. Actually, by providing anonymity,
Tor makes it more difficult to perform a man-in-the-middle attack targeted on a
specific user with the blessing of a rogue SSL certificate.

## Confirmation attacks

The Tor design doesn't try to protect against an attacker who can see or measure
both traffic going into the Tor network and also traffic coming out of the Tor
network. That's because if you can see both flows, some simple statistics let
you decide whether they match up.

The way we generally explain it is that Tor tries to protect against traffic
analysis, where an attacker tries to learn whom to investigate, but Tor can't
protect against traffic confirmation (also known as end-to-end correlation),
where an attacker tries to confirm a hypothesis by monitoring the right
locations in the network and then doing the math.

anonymity"](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough).
