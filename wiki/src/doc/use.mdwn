[[!meta title="Use Tails"]]

In this section we will now briefly present how to use Tails, and especially
the the main applications
included in Tails. Users are encouraged to look for further
information about them elsewhere and to experiment (while not doing
anything sensitive!) for their own benefit. All the pictures are
clickable to get them undistorted and in full size, but note that some
of the text is smudged in order to protect identities.
