Warnings
========

**The content of the USB stick will be lost in the operation.**

If at some point you are not sure about a device name it is
recommended to stop proceeding otherwise **you might risk overwriting
any hard drive on the system**.

Step by step
============

Step 1: Run DiskPart
--------------------

Run the `diskpart` command in a command prompt.

Step 2: Find out the disk number of the USB stick
-------------------------------------------------

Unplug the USB stick.

Type the following command to list disks known to DiskPart:

	list disk

DiskPart should display a list of disks and information about them.

Plug back the destination USB stick.

Run the `list disk` command again.

A new disk should have appeared in the list.

Double-check that its properties, such as its size, match the
expectations you have of the USB stick you want to reset, and take
good note of the *number* assigned by DiskPart to this disk.

Step 3: Select the USB stick
----------------------------

Tell DiskPart you want to operate on the USB stick; this is done using
the select command as follows, replacing `NUMBER` with the disk number
you have taken note of previously:

	select disk=NUMBER

Step 4: Do the actual reset
---------------------------

Ask DiskPart to remove all partitions from the selected disk:

	clean
