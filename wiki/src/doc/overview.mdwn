What is Tails?

Tails is a live system: a complete operating-system designed to be used from a
CD or a USB stick. It can help you to:

- use the Internet anonymously almost anywhere you go, home, work, university,
  favourite Internet caf√© or local library;
- leave no trace on computer's hard-disk unless explicitely asked.

Tails is [Free Software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) and based
on [Debian GNU/Linux](http://www.debian.org/). It comes with several built-in
applications pre-configured with security in mind: web browser, instant
messaging client, email client, office suite, image and sound editor, etc.

Anonymity online through Tor
----------------------------

Tails relies on the Tor anonymity network to protect your privacy online: all
outgoing connections to the Internet are forced to go through Tor.

Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against a form of
network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential
business activities and relationships, and state security known as traffic
analysis.

Tor protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of
relays run by volunteers all around the world: it prevents somebody watching
your Internet connection from learning what sites you visit, and it prevents the
sites you visit from learning your physical location.

To learn more about Tor, see the official [Tor
website](https://www.torproject.org/):

Use anywhere but leave no trace
-------------------------------

Using Tails on a computer doesn't alter or depend on the operating system
installed on it. So you can use it in the same way on yours, the computer of a
friend or one at your local library. After removing your Tails CD or USB stick
the computer can start again on its usual operating system.

Tails is configured with a special care to not use the computer's hard-disks,
even if there is some swap space on it. The only storage space used by Tails is
the RAM memory, which is automatically erased when the computer shuts down. So
you won't leave any trace neither of the Tails system nor of what you did on
the computer. That's why we call it "amnesic".

This allows you to work on sensitive documents on any computer and protect you
from data recovery after shutdown. Of course, you can still explicitly save
some documents to another USB or external hard-disk and take them aways for
future use.
