"In this section we will now briefly present how to use Tails, and especially "
"the the main applications included in Tails. Users are encouraged to look "
"for further information about them elsewhere and to experiment (while not "
"doing anything sensitive!) for their own benefit. All the pictures are "
"clickable to get them undistorted and in full size, but note that some of "
"the text is smudged in order to protect identities."
