Tails works with any resonabley modern PC computer â€“ say manuractured after 2005.

# Startup device

To run Tails, your computer must be able to have a CD reader (and to start on
it) or to start on USB stick.

# Processor requirement

Tails requires an x86 compatible processor.

# Memory requirements

Tails (0.7.x) requires 1GB of RAM to work smoothly. It is known to work with
less memory, but you might experience strange behaviours or crashes, which we do
**not** consider at Tails bug.
