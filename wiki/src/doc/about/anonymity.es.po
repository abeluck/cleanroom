"As you are probably aware of, we currently find ourselves in a state of "
"steady decline of our freedoms and privacy, with increasing levels of mass "
"surveillance and repression all over the world (see [this report from "
"Privacy International](http://www.privacyinternational.org/article.shtml?cmd"
"%5B347%5D=x-347-559597))."

"Without taking any precautions, your Internet service provider, the State, "
"the police and global surveillance systems like [ECHELON](http://en."
"wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON) (which is _not_ a conspiracy theory; see [this "
"report from the European Parliament](http://www.fas.org/irp/program/process/"
"rapport_echelon_en.pdf))  can record what you do online: what you read, what "
"you write and who you communicate with."

"This is possible since all messages sent over the Internet contain the [IP "
"addresses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ip_address) of both the sender and "
"receiver, much like an ordinary mail sent through the postal system contains "
"addresses of both sender and receiver for two-ways communication. IP "
"addresses can easily be traced back to the physical location of the "
"computers and their owners, and from that ultimately back to you."

"At last, some applications have features and services that may compromise "
"the anonymity offered by the Tor network. All modern web browsers, such as "
"Firefox, support [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript), "
"[Adobe Flash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_flash), [Cookies](http://en."
"wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) and other services which have been shown to "
"be able to defeat the anonymity provided by the Tor network."

"When running Iceweasel (Firefox) in Tails all such features are handled by "
"an extension called [Torbutton](https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/) which "
"does all sorts of things to prevent the above type of attacks. But that "
"comes at a price â€“ since this will disable some functionalitys, some sites "
"might not work as intended."
