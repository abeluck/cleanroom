[[!meta title="About Tails anonymity"]]

# <a name="why"></a>Why do you need anonymity?

As you are probably aware of, we currently find ourselves in a state of
steady decline of our freedoms and privacy, with increasing levels of
mass surveillance and repression all over the world (see [this report
from Privacy
International](http://www.privacyinternational.org/article.shtml?cmd%5B347%5D=x-347-559597)).

Without taking any precautions, your Internet service provider, the
state, the police and global surveillance systems like
[ECHELON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON) (which is _not_ a
conspiracy theory; see [this report from the European
Parliament](http://www.fas.org/irp/program/process/rapport_echelon_en.pdf))
can record what you do online: what you read, what you write and who
you communicate with.

This is possible since all messages sent over
the Internet contain the [IP
addresses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ip_address) of both the sender
and receiver, much like an ordinary mail sent through the postal
system contain addresses of both sender and receiver for two-way
communication. IP addresses can easily be traced back to the physical
location of the computers and their owners, and from that ultimately
back to you.

If you do not mind this fact, then more power to you, but if you do
mind, then Tails might be just what you need.

Moreover, just like with a postcard, any information traveling on the
Internet can be read by many computers that relay them.

# <a name="how"></a>How does Tails provide with anonymity?

**FIXME**: semi-duplicated section: this and the [[about]] page are
duplicated information. Merge or inline the [[about]] page (whithout what's
next) here?

First of all, true anonymity is impossible. Given enough resources an
attacker will get you. What one can do is to make the cost of doing
that so high that it becomes infeasible.

Tails tries to do this by sending all your Internet traffic through
the [Tor™ network](https://www.torproject.org/) which makes your
Internet traffic very hard to trace. If someone tries to trace you
when you are using Tails, the trail will stop somewhere in Tor
network with the IP addresses of some of its participants, not your.
Similarly, if someone tries to see destination of your traffic, they
will only reach as far as some computer in the Tor network. In fact,
you will be the only one knowing exactly what is going on – not even
the computers in the Tor network that you send your traffic through
will know the whole picture!

As at least a rudimentary understanding of Tor currently is essential
for using it securely (and knowing its limits) we strongly recommend
reading the [Tor overview](https://www.torproject.org/overview.html)
and [Understanding and Using Tor – An Introduction for the
Layman](https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorALaymansGuide).
At the very least you should read the following paragraphs about
common misconceptions about the service offered by the Tor software.

By relaying your Internet traffic through the Tor network (which
Tails does per default) your communications should _only_ be
considered to be untraceable back to the computer you use, not
encrypted or in any other way unreadable by others. While the traffic
_is_ encrypted when it leaves your computer and when you get back your
responses, it will not necessarily be so when sent between the Tor
network and your destination (this is unavoidable for technical
reasons). This means that an eavesdropper at some later point will be
able see your traffic without Tor's encryption unless you take further
precautions (described [later on](#ff)), but will not be able to link
it back to your computer.

As such, if you are sending or receiving sensitive data whose
disclosure would be damaging in itself even if it is untraceable, you
need to use end-to-end encryption to hide the meaning of your data to
everyone except the recipient. Examples of such sensitive information
that you need to protect in this way are your real identity or other
personal information linkable to you, login details and passwords,
bank account or financial details, anything illegal or political, and
secrets in general.

There are several tools bundled with Tails offering end-to-end
encryption for various applications: [GnuPG](http://www.gnupg.org/)
provides with encryption for email,
[OTR](http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr) is for instant messaging (MSN,
ICQ, IRC, etc.) among others.

Also, bear in mind that while web browsing on sites for whom the
addresses begin with `http://` the connections are not encrypted (see
[more about this](#ff)). However, web sites whose addresses start with
`https://` (notice the additional "**s**") use encrypted connections
and are thus **s**ecure. FIXME: tell a bit about certificates and
X.509 limits. Many web browsers, including Firefox, also display a
lock or a similar symbol in the address field or status bar indicating
that the connection is secure.

Notice that not all web sites offer this feature, but most that in any
way handle your data (webmail logins, bank account logins etc.)
usually do. Keep your eyes open!

Furthermore, most software bundled with Tails will warn you when
your previously encrypted connection switches to unencrypted mode: be
careful!

At last, some applications have features and services that may
compromise the anonymity offered by the Tor network. All modern web
browsers, such as Firefox, support
[JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript), [Adobe
Flash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_flash),
[Cookies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) and other services
which have been shown to be able to defeat the anonymity provided by
the Tor network.

For instance, a web page using JavaScript can make your web browser
send your real IP address to the web server hosting the web page which
possibly can disclose it not only to the web server's owner but also
eavesdroppers that happen to fetch the message when it is sent between
the Tor network and the web server.

When running Iceweasel (Firefox) in Tails all such features are
handled by an extension called
[Torbutton](https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/) which does all
sorts of things to prevent the above type of attacks. But that comes
at a price – since this will disable some functionality, certain sites
might not work as intended.
