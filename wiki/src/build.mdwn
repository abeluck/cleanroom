One may want to [[customize]] her image before building.

Every following command must be run as `root`, at the root of the
source directory one has [[downloaded|download]].

For the impatient ones:

	$ git clone git://git.immerda.ch/amnesia.git
	$ cd amnesia
	$ sudo su
	# lh config --language en
	# lh build

Details
=======

Initialize the Live system's configuration with `lh_config`:

	lh_config

Optionally set your preferred language for the generated images; only
"fr" is currently fully supported, but other languages are still worth
trying, such as "de" or en":

	lh_config --language fr

You can then use the standard live-helper commands to build the chosen
images (`lh build`) and to cleanup the build directory (`lh clean`).
