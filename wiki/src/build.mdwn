One may want to [[customize]] her image before building.

Every following command must be run as `root`, at the root of the
source directory one has [[downloaded|download]].

For the impatient ones:

	$ git clone git://git.immerda.ch/amnesia.git
	$ cd amnesia
	$ sudo su
	# lh config --language en
	# lh build

Details

Dependencies
------------

* `live-helper` 2.0~a1+20091120 or newer: the
  [Debian Live manual](http://live.debian.net/manual/html/) explains
  how to install a snapshot package.
* A patched ikiwiki is probably needed; see this
  [wishlist item](http://ikiwiki.info/todo/mirrorlist_with_per-mirror_usedirs_settings/)
  to get the custom ikiwiki branch that has the needed code.

Build process
-------------

Initialize the Live system's configuration with `lh config`:

	lh config

Optionally set your preferred language for the generated images; only
"fr" is currently fully supported, but other languages are still worth
trying, such as "de" or en":

	lh config --language fr

You can then use the standard live-helper commands to build the chosen
images (`lh build`) and to cleanup the build directory (`lh clean`).
