<br />
**Beware! the following will be true in T(A)ILS 0.7; TrueCrypt is not included in T(A)ILS 0.6.x yet.**
<br />

Security considerations
=======================

Even if *TrueCrypt* looks like free software, it is not included in Debian
due to its restrictive license. The development is done in a closed
fashion, so even if the source code is free, we can assume than there is
not much review happening on a daily basis.

For all the above reasons, *T(A)ILS* developers do not recommend to use
*TrueCrypt*. We do include *TrueCrypt* only to allow users of the (old
and now unsupported) *Incognito* live system to access the data on
previously created media.

In the future, we would like to
[[provide proper
alternatives|todo/provide_a_migration_path_from_truecrypt]] and stop distributing *TrueCrypt*. This means that you
should **not** create new TrueCrypt media if you intend to stay with
T(A)ILS in the long run.

Using TrueCrypt in T(A)ILS
==========================

*TrueCrypt* is not enabled by default when T(A)ILS starts. In order to
use *TrueCrypt*, the following needs to be done:

- on the language selection menu, right after booting T(A)ILS, use the
  arrow keys to select the desired system language,
- press the *tab* key (often labeled â†¹), press *space*, type
  `truecrypt` and press *enter*,
- when T(A)ILS desktop is ready, you should find *TrueCrypt* in
  the *Applications* menu, under *Accessories*.
