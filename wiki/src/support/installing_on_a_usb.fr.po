"Running T(A)ILS from a CD has its virtues but it certainly also have its "
"limitations. While CDs are portable they usually do not fit in your pocket "
"in a comfortable manner. But a USB memory stick certainly fits any pocket or "
"your key ring. In addition, CDs are read-only and thus no data can be saved "
"to them, but that is, again, not the case with USB drives. However, storing "
"sensitive data on writeable media could be dangerous if it got into the "
"wrong hands. Similarly, if we get a virus or manages to damage the system in "
"other ways, the system is tainted or unusable from that point and all "
"consecutive boots, either with or without your knowledge. Clearly that is "
"not good."

"Note that the method of installing T(A)ILS to USB is pretty crude at the "
