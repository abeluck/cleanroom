"You should NOT trust Windows to be secure enough as a host if you have "
"anything to risk if your activites in Tails would be linked to you "
"personally or leaked. Windows could be made a tiny bit more trustworthy if "
"you installed a HIPS (Host Intrusion Prevention System)  with high security "
"settings instantly after installing Windows (fresh from a genuine Windows "
"CD/DVD, nothing less can be trusted to 100%, not even preinstalled "
"Windows). If you install a HIPS first after using Windows for some time "
"(less then an hour online is enough) you could already have a rootkit that "
"the HIPS can't detect."
