[[!meta title="Virtualization: tips and tricks"]]

[[!toc levels=2]]

As explained on the [[virtualization warning
page|support/virtualization]], using Tails in a Virtual Machine
involves you put great trust into the host operating system and the
virtualization software.

Here are some tips may help hardening (a bit) the host operating
system.

# Operating systems

## Microsoft Windows

You should NOT trust Windows to be secure enough as a host if you have
anything to risk if your activites in Tails would be linked to you
personally or leaked. Windows could be made a tiny bit more
trustworthy if you installed a HIPS (Host Intrusion Prevention System)
with high security settings instantly after installing Windows (fresh
from a genuine Windows CD/DVD, nothing less can be trusted to 100%,
not even preinstalled Windows). If you install a HIPS first after
using Windows for some time (less then an hour online is enough) you
could already have a rootkit that the HIPS can't detect.
