FIXME: shouldn't the paragraph "Tails and Virtualization" from [[walkthrough]]
come here?

Security issues
===============

When running Tails inside a virtual machine, both the host operating system
and the virtualization software are able to monitor what you are doing in
Tails. Moreover traces are likely to be left on the local hard disk.

That's why Tails warns you when you are running it inside a virtual
machine.

If you read this warning while you are not aware to be using a virtual
machine:  there could be a [[bug|found_a_problem]] in the
virtualization detection software Tails uses... or something really
weird is happening.

Using Tails in a VM should only be considered secure if you know that you can trust the underlying OS. You should NOT trust Windows to be secure enough as a host if you have anything to risk if your activites in Tails would be linked to you personally or leaked.
Windows could be trusted if you installed a HIPS (Host Intrusion Prevention System) with high security settings instantly after installing Windows (fresh from a genuine Windows CD/DVD, nothing less can be trusted to 100%, not even preinstalled Windows).
If you install a HIPS first after using Windows for some time (less then an hour online is enough) you could already have a rootkit that the HIPS can't detect.

If you are unsure, just run Tails from a LiveCD. Make sure that you have verified the ISO file first so that nobody has tampered with it. Go find a local Linux user group or similiar for assistance if you need it.
