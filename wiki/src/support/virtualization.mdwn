FIXME: shouldn't the paragraph "Tails and Virtualization" from [[walkthrough]]
come here?

Security issues
===============


When running Tails inside a virtual machine, both the host operating system
and the virtualization software are able to monitor what you are doing in
Tails. Moreover, traces of your activities with Tails are likely to be left on the local hard disk when running Tails in a Virtual Machine.

During boot, Tails checks for the presence of virtualization software and warns you when it is run inside a virtual machine.

If you read the warning during boot while you are **not aware** to be using a virtual
machine, **consider it a strong warning that your computer is running a rootkit without your knowledge and someone is eavesdropping on you.**

On some hardware configurations, there is a small chance that of a false positive, i.e. the virtualization detection software Tails uses [[wrongly|found_a_problem]] detects the presence of a Virtual Machine.


The Tails Project recommends to boot Tails directly from a CD or USB flash drive.

operating system and virtualization software a tiny bit more secure.
