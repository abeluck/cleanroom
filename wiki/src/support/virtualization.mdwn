FIXME: shouldn't the paragraph "T(A)ILS and Virtualization" from [[walkthrough]]
come here?

Security issues
===============

When running T(A)ILS inside a virtual machine, both the host operating system
and the virtualization software are able to monitor what you are doing in
T(A)ILS. Moreover traces are likely to be left in the host computer.

That's why T(A)ILS tries to warn you when you are running it inside a virtual
machine.

If you get this warning while you are not aware to be using a virtual machine:
there could be a <a href='https://amnesia.boum.org/found_a_problem/'>bug</a> in
the virtualization detection software T(A)ILS uses... or something really weird
is happening.
