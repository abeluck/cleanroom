Some machines have been reported to have problems starting Tails.

This list might not be accurate nor complete.

Tails will not use memory after the first 3 GB
----------------------------------------------

Tails will not currently use more than 3 GB of memory, even if more
is installed on the system. This is a limitation of the [[current
kernel selection mechanism|todo/nx_bit]].

Tails will only use one core
----------------------------

Tails will not currently use more than one CPU core, even if there is
more core or more CPUs installed on the system. This is a limitation of the
[[current kernel selection mechanism|todo/nx_bit]].

Tails do not erase all the system memory on shutdown
----------------------------------------------------

Tails does not consistently [[erase all system memory as it
should|bugs/sdmem_does_not_clear_all_memory]].
It depends on the overall system memory, but it currently fails
to properly erase around 1.5 GB on a 4 GB system.

Apple hardware
--------------

For the moment, Tails has a very limited support for Apple hardware.

Most recent Apple hardware does not boot without UEFI, and currently
Tails do not start with UEFI. See the corresponding
[[ticket|/todo/UEFI]].
