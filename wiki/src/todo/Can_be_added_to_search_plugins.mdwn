What about disabling family filters on the search plugins? I don't think kids are going to use Tails. I don't like filters, even though I don't search for p0rn.

Probably you like using the default plugins, me too. But I think if we are adding alternative search engines, there should be no problem editing them.

####For Startpage

I use this addition:

    <os:Param name="prfh" value="disable_family_filterEEE1N1Npicture_privacyEEEonN1Ndisable_video_family_filterEEE1N1N"/>

If you're not going to disable filters I still recommend adding:

    <os:Param name="prfh" value="picture_privacyEEEonN1N"/>

When using this, all images (and also the website after you click the image) come through the ixquick-proxy . I saw you made startpage default for next release. I agree with this idea. So if it's going to be default I also think this "picture_privacy" should be added for more privacy.

Note: Unlike "query" or "language" params, these type of preferences cannot be added directly. You can use extra preferences in search plugins only this way. ("name"EEE"value"N1N)

####For DuckDuckGo

I use safe search off:

    <os:Param name="kp" value="-1"/>

####For ixquick

I don't think it's necessary because startpage is same as ixquick and also it's better because it has the time filters which is an important feature for searching:

    Any time - Past 24 hours - Past week - Past month - Past year

So would you delete ixquick?

####For Scroogle

It's not a reliable service and after I started using Startpage I think it's completely unnecessary. Because startpage/ixquick using google too and they have better design and more features. But if people want to use it, I don't know, your choice.

####Debian-provided search plugins

Is it not a good idea to edit these plugins? I see there are many bad params in them. But is it not safe to edit them? Like deleting *Param name="aq"* *Param name="rls"* from google? What about adding only *Param name="safe" value="off"*
