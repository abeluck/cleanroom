Further to the recent bug "Iceweasel exposes a rare User-Agent" linked
to Debian bug #595375, could a user-agent changer plugin be
incorporated into iceweasel?

As a suggestion could the User-Agent-Switcher plugin from
chrispederick.com be used? I find this a very simple and configurable
plugin and has worked well for me.

Changing your user-agent and using tor's change identify is a very
easy way of altering your profile across websites.
