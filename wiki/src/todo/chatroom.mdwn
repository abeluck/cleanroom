1. Create the `incognito` chatroom (MUC) on jabber.ccc.de **done**
2. Configure Pidgin to easily connect to this chatroom. [[!taglink
   todo/research]] what Jabber account(s) amnesia users can
   connect with.
3. Configure Pidgin to check the server's identity as best as can be
   done, using SSL CA if no better solution can be found.
4. Write some documentation on the website for users who want to chat
   with us *and* aren't able to use our live system to do so.
5. Wait and see if we're asked for another way to join the chatroom;
   if we are, maybe setup a forwarding bot to a IRC channel.
