1. Create the `incognito` chatroom (MUC) on jabber.ccc.de **done**
2. Configure Pidgin to easily connect to this server **done**, works
   with several Live systems in parallel
   * account = `amnesiac`
   * password = `aixe2uinu2eoG2Mae9ox`
   * `Resource` field = randomized at boot time
3. Add this chatroom to the buddy list **done**
4. Randomize the nickname as well **done**
5. Configure Pidgin to check the server's identity as best as can be
   done: **done** using SSL CA, as no better solution could be found.
6. Make sure no backlog of a given user is displayed to another
   (they're using the same account, after all).
7. Write some documentation on the website for users who want to chat
   with us *and* aren't able to use our live system to do so:
   **done** on [[chat]], which will need to be updated once a release
   includes the aforementioned XMPP configuration.
8. Wait and see if we're asked for another way to join the chatroom;
   if we are, maybe setup a forwarding bot to a IRC channel.

Remaining issues
================

[[!taglink todo/research]]

* can any user change the password for the shared Jabber account?
  if so, how can we lock it a bit more?
