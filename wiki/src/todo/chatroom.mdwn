1. Create the `incognito` chatroom (MUC) on jabber.ccc.de **done**
2. Configure Pidgin to easily connect to this chatroom (implemented,
   but the `sed` in
   `config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/live-bottom/31pidgin_xmpp_account`
   is **buggy**: `accounts.xml` ends up empty => [[!taglink todo/code]]):
   * account = `amnesiac`
   * password = `aixe2uinu2eoG2Mae9ox`
   * `Resource` field = randomized at boot time
3. Configure Pidgin to check the server's identity as best as can be
   done, using SSL CA if no better solution can be found.
4. Write some documentation on the website for users who want to chat
   with us *and* aren't able to use our live system to do so:
   **done** on [[chat]], which will need to be updated once a release
   includes the aforementioned XMPP configuration.
5. Wait and see if we're asked for another way to join the chatroom;
   if we are, maybe setup a forwarding bot to a IRC channel.
