Currently it just silently fails (unless the user looks in /var/log/htpdate.log) which isn't nice. A pop-up similar to the one stating that time syncing has started should appear in this case, showing the relevant parts of the logs and suggesting further course of action for the user.

> Implemented in the devel branch. [[!tag pending]].
