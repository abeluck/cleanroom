Add an Incognito-like boot menu to choose the language at runtime,
instead of building per-language images.

Implementation
==============

* Install various Scroogle SSL search engines for other
  to-be-supported languages.
* Use our in-house, not published yet, *amnesiabranding* iceweasel
  extension to localize the default search engine at runtime.
* See how many Debian localization packages fit on one CD (see
  `config/chroot_local-packageslists/amnesia-fr` for an example).
  - 500kB for each `iceweasel-l10n-*`
  - 1MB for each `icedove-l10n-*`
  - 30-60MB for each `kde-i18n-*`: removed if we [[switch from TorK to Vidalia|ship Vidalia instead of TorK]]
  - 7MB for each `openoffice.org-l10n-*`
  - 30MB for each `openoffice.org-help-*`: probably need to be sacrificed
  - ??MB for each `openoffice.org-hyphenation-*`: many languages are
    only in >= Squeeze
  - ??MB for each `openoffice.org-thesaurus-*`: many languages are
    only in >= Squeeze
* Implement a language-choosing boot menu.
* Write the `live-initramfs` hooks needed to localize the boot
  depending on the user's language choice.
* Contribute our implementation to the Debian Live upstream.

boot menu
---------

To be tried:

* steal the Incognito [implementation](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/arch/x86/overlay/isolinux/)
* see if one has been contributed by the Debian Live community
  ([probably not](http://lists.debian.org/debian-live/2008/09/msg00045.html))
  yet
* steal the debian-installer
  [implementation](http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/d-i/trunk/packages/localechooser/#_trunk_packages_localechooser_)
* find another Live system that implemented this properly

Implementation notes:

* the [syslinux](http://packages.qa.debian.org/s/syslinux.html) only
  supports gfxboot since 3.74, which is in Squeeze but not in Lenny;
  it only has to be installed on the dev/build box, not inside the
  Live system
* [discussion](http://www.mail-archive.com/debian-live@lists.debian.org/msg01381.html)
  about gfxboot on the Debian Live mailing-list
* some Debian developers
  [intend to package](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=465768)
  the gfxboot bootlogo creator
* the [Ubuntu gfxboot theme](http://packages.ubuntu.com/karmic/gfxboot-theme-ubuntu)
  might be a good starting point for a Debian Live gfxboot-enabled
  menu; it seems pretty complete and clever.xs

Miscellaneous ideas
===================

Additionally go on supporting building pre-localized images?
