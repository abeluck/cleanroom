Add an Incognito-like boot menu to choose the language at runtime,
instead of building per-language images.

Implementation
==============

* [[!tag todo/code]] Install various Scroogle SSL search engines for other
  to-be-supported languages.
* use our custom *amnesiabranding* iceweasel extension to localize at runtime:
    - the default search engine: done for FR, **buggy** for EN
      (Scroogle FR is still the default search engine)
    - the homepage: done for EN, FR
    - set a default search engine / homepage for unknown locales
      somewhere else than in `user.js`, as the `user.js` setting
      overrides the one set by the extension [[!tag todo/code]]
* [[!tag todo/research]] See how many Debian localization packages fit
  on one CD (see `config/chroot_local-packageslists/amnesia-fr` for an
  example).
  - 500kB for each `iceweasel-l10n-*`
  - 7MB for each `openoffice.org-l10n-*`
  - ??MB for each `openoffice.org-hyphenation-*`: many languages are
    only in >= Squeeze
  - ??MB for each `openoffice.org-thesaurus-*`: many languages are
    only in >= Squeeze
* [[!taglink todo/wait]] for upstream to implement a language-choosing
  boot menu and maybe help them; seems well engaged
* [[!taglink todo/code]] the `live-initramfs` hooks needed to localize the boot
  depending on the user's language choice.

### gfxboot

The Debian Live main developer has
[uploaded](http://packages.qa.debian.org/g/gfxboot.html)
[gfxboot](http://en.opensuse.org/Gfxboot) to Debian. Some early
description of his work has been
[posted](http://lists.debian.org/debian-live/2009/09/msg00032.html).
This will allow to implement nice and possibly complex boot menus.

### GRUB 2

GRUB 2 also implements a
[graphical menu system](http://grub.enbug.org/Subprojects/GraphicalMenu)...
but Debian Live does not support GRUB 2 yet.

ressources
----------

- <http://webconverger.org/i18n/> (they don't support CJK as it takes
  100M+)
- have a look to tasksel's chinese-s-desktop, arabic-desktop, and so
  on for fonts, input systems, etc.

Miscellaneous ideas
===================

* Additionally go on supporting building pre-localized images?
* Remember the chosen locale when using a writable boot device?
  (needs discussion, this breaks the "no persistence unless
  explicitly told" requirement)
