Add an Incognito-like boot menu to choose the language at runtime,
instead of building per-language images.

Implementation
==============

* Install various Scroogle SSL search engines for other
  to-be-supported languages.
* Use our in-house, not published yet, *amnesiabranding* iceweasel
  extension to localize the default search engine at runtime.
* See how many Debian localization packages fit on one CD (see
  `config/chroot_local-packageslists/amnesia-fr` for an example).
* Implement the language-choosing boot menu. Either steal the
  Incognito one, or see if one has been contributed by the Debian Live
  community, or write a brand new implementation.
* Write the `live-initramfs` hooks needed to localize the boot
  depending on the user's language choice.

Miscellaneous ideas
===================

Additionally go on supporting building pre-localized images?
