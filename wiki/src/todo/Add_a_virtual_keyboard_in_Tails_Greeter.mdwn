Considering the use of Tails with persistence, the passphrase has to be written using the keyboard in Tails Greeter, and we could like to unlock the persistent volume avoiding a potential keylogger.

So, having a Virtual Keyboard in Tails Greeter would be great.

# Implementation research

A proof of concept has been implemented :

- add florence.desktop to gdm greeter session
- florence needs a system tray to enable user to access its icon, so,
  install trayer and add a corresponding .deskptop to gdm
  greeter session.

This works, but a solution which does not require to display another panel has to be found.

> How hard would it be to have the existing tails-greeter panel act as a system tray?
