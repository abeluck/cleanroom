The Debian X strike force maintains Xorg backports for Squeeze:
<http://x.debian.net/reference/squeeze-backports.html>.

We probably want to ship them in Tails for better recent hardware
support.

This is mostly implemented in our `feature/backported_xorg` Git
branch.

Left to do
==========

virtualbox-guest-x11
--------------------

virtualbox-guest-x11 in squeeze-backports is obviously built against
Squeeze's Xorg ABI. We need to rebuilt it in a Squeeze chroot that
prefers using the backported Xorg development packages when needed.

needs updated kernel
--------------------

At least the `nouveau` video driver needs a newer kernel. Since the
`nv` driver has been removed, complying with this requirement is
critical.

This change is already implemented (and maintained) in the
`feature/lzma` branch (see [[better SquashFS
compression|todo/use_lzma_compression]]), that's why I did not
duplicate this work in `feature/backported_xorg`.

[[!taglink todo/wait]] for the `feature/lzma` branch to be merged.
