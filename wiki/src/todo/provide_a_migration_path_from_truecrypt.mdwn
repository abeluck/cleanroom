[[!meta title="Provide a migration path from TrueCrypt"]]

TrueCrypt is [[now included|todo/include_truecrypt]] in Tails, but with its
license and development practices, we would like to provide a migration
path from TrueCrypt.

Future work:

- [[!taglink todo/research]], implement and possibly document
  replacement solutions.
 * [RealCrypt](http://rpmfusion.org/Package/realcrypt): one Fedora
   maintainer forked TrueCrypt and ships 3rd-party RPMs outside of
   Fedora.
