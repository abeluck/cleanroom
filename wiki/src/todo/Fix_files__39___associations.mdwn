Several file types are associated with the wrong application. Here is a bunch of files' associations that should be fixed.

Feel free to complete.

- when runnig nautilus as root, text files are opened with gobby instead of gedit.
- when opening a PDF file in Iceweasel, gimp is the preselected choice instead of Evince.
- when opening a EXE file, with the *wine* package installed, the unarchiver comes first.
