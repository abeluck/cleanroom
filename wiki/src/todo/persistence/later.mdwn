# usecases

* [[todo/system_wide_persistence]]
* [[todo/full_home_persistence]]

# storage location

* Use persistence without a persistence media: an encrypted persistent
  archive could be [[remotely stored|todo/remote_persistent_storage]]
  on existing storage services.
* In the long run we may want to support plain dm-crypt mappings
  hidden in files: something similar to the `live-media-offset` would
  be perfect; the UI side of it will be tricky if we want to ask the
  offset to the user; this could happen either in the boot menu or by
  hooking a menu that would probably run from inside the initramfs,
  before `scripts/live` attempts to copy snapshots data. See
  [[todo/boot_menu]].

# profiles

See [[todo/per-profile_persistence]].

# user interface

* support bootstrapping persistent storage when running from CD; only
  differences probably arise from the fact that partitioning and
  partitions usage are not well-known in this case.
* support *removing* from the list of persistent items
