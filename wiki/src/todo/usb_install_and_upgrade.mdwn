Allow installing amnesia to a USB storage device

* from a running (CD or USB) amnesia system
* from another OS, using a downloaded ISO image

=> no need to distribute USB images anymore

specification
=============

* allow adding a second encrypted data partition, or at least leave
  room for it
* allow non-destructively upgrading the live system only, not touching
  the other partitions (use the iso + grub trick ? tar image
  + cp?)

booting methods

### syslinux hybrid image

syslinux >3.72 (in Squeeze, not Lenny) supports generating images
which can be either a CD-ROM or a hard disk (USB disk, etc.); this
is done by postprocessing an ISO image. The resulting image can then
be copied using any raw disk writing tool (typically "dd" or "cat")
to a USB disk, or written to a CD-ROM using standard CD burning
tools. See `/usr/share/doc/syslinux-common/isolinux.txt.gz` for
more information.

Test method:

1. build an amnesia ISO image as usual
2. copy recent enough `/usr/lib/syslinux/{isolinux.bin,vesamenu.c32}`
   isolinux files (e.g. the ones from Squeeze) to `binary/isolinux/`
3. generate an ISO image including the updated isolinux, using
   a simplified (!) version of the command that lh runs:
        cd binary
        genisoimage -J -l -cache-inodes -allow-multidot  -no-emul-boot \
          -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table -r -b isolinux/isolinux.bin \
          -c isolinux/boot.cat -o ../test.iso
4. postprocess the ISO: `isohybrid -entry 4 -type 1c test.iso`.

This process could of course be automated.

Successful tests:

* boot the resulting `test.iso` as a normal optical drive in
  VirtualBox
* convert the resulting `test.iso`, posing as a HDD image, into the
  native VirtualBox disk format, using `VBoxManage
  convertfromraw -format VDI test.iso test.vdi`, then boot the
  resulting `test.vdi` disk image in VirtualBox
* `dd` the hybrid `test.iso` to a USB stick and boot it on
  a USB-boot-enabled computer.

Notes:

* the partition number may need to be 4, in order to be compatible
  with the BIOSes supporting only USB-Zip;
  [reference](http://syslinux.zytor.com/archives/2009-May/012380.html)
* the partition type may need to be `1c`, i.e. hidden FAT32 LBA;
  [reference](http://syslinux.zytor.com/archives/2009-May/012384.html)
* boot failures were experimented when testing without the `-entry
  4 -type 1c` options.

Conclusion: this is a nice way to get bootable USB images for almost
free. A recent-enough syslinux, backported for Lenny, can be installed
from the [debian-unofficial backports
repository](http://backports.undebian.org/repositories/backports-other/).

### misc

* apart when using a setup able to boot an ISO image, one needs to
  copy the ISO's `live/` directory to the destination partition, and
  setup a bootloader there
* use grml's
  [patches to live-initramfs](http://git.grml.org/?p=live-initramfs-grml.git;a=tree;f=debian/patches) 
  to support directly booting an ISO image... merged in upstream Git,
  commit 6458a8862db68
* Philip Hands' solution proposed on Debian's bug
  [#534887](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=534887)
  uses extlinux chainloading the image's own bootloader

### Grub2

Grub 2 initial support has entered `live-helper` in commit
566d27904afb3715. Chainload the ISO from here?

frontend UI
-----------

* `live-installer` udeb and its `live-installer-launcher` desktop
  companion
* Incognito's `root_overlay/usr/sbin/create-usb` seems quite nice, as
  it allows using an existing fat32 partition, but it does not
  proposes to partition the USB device first. Their own
  [TODO](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/TODO)
  contains some nice ideas about the current topic.
* Ubuntu's [usb-creator](FIXME)
   - supposed to replicate exactly the CD to USB
   - does not seem to recognize non-Ubuntu CDs (0.1.16 crashes on
     Lenny, 0.1.10 does not display them in the GUI even if it the
     console output proves that it takes good note of their presence )
   - how does it handle partitions?
   - [launchpad](https://launchpad.net/usb-creator)
* [UNetbootin](http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/)
   - works on Windows and GNU/Linux
   - has a plugin architecture in case we need new or custom features
   - included in squeeze and sid, easily backported to Lenny
   - works like a charm to install an ISO image to USB, but the
     syslinux menu has the unetbootin logo instead of Debian's one
   - non-destructive install: does not format the chosen partition
   - **TRY ME**: from a running Live CD to USB? (seems to need to dd
     the CD to an ISO file first, which uses a lot of memory)
   - **TRY ME**: .img image to USB?
* [Ubuntu LiveUSB](http://klik.atekon.de/liveusb/)
   - (a bit too) simplistic
   - dedicated to "create a bootable Live USB medium from a running
     Ubuntu Live CD"
   - depending on sources, it partitions USB stick with one single
     800MB partition or one partition using the whole device; in any
     case, it unconditionally overwrites the device's content
   - able to upgrade without re-partitioning the device?
   - [launchpad](https://launchpad.net/liveusb)
* sidux's `install-sidux-usb-gui` needs an input ISO, but it still
  deserves being looked at more thoroughly; see the
  [manual](http://manual.sidux.com/en/hd-install-opts-en.htm#usb-hd).
* Fedora's `livecd-iso-to-disk`:
   - [manual](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FedoraLiveCD/USBHowTo)
* Fedora's [liveusb-creator](https://fedorahosted.org/liveusb-creator/):
   - works on Windows and GNU/Linux
   - "non-destructive install", which means?
   - sidux ships a modified version:
     which does not work on Lenny due to `dosfslabel` exiting with
     error code 1 even when successful
      - [.deb](http://sidux.office-vienna.at/sidux/debian/pool/main/l/liveusb-creator/),
      - [source](http://w3you.com/liveusb-creator/liveusb-creator.htm)
   - needs an ISO file, does not know how to read a real CD
