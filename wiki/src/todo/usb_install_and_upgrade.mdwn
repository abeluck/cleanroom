Allow installing amnesia to a USB storage device

* from a running (CD or USB) amnesia system
* from another OS, using a downloaded ISO image

=> no need to distribute USB images anymore

specification
=============

* allow adding a second encrypted data partition, or at least leave
  room for it
* allow non-destructively upgrading the live system only, not touching
  the other partitions (use the iso + grub trick ? tar image
  + cp?)

research
========

booting methods
---------------

* apart when using a setup able to boot an ISO image, one needs to
  copy the ISO's `live/` directory to the destination partition, and
  setup a bootloader there
* use grml's
  [patches to live-initramfs](http://git.grml.org/?p=live-initramfs-grml.git;a=tree;f=debian/patches) 
  to support directly booting an ISO image... merged in upstream Git,
  commit 6458a8862db68
* Philip Hands' solution proposed on Debian's bug
  [#534887](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=534887)
  uses extlinux chainloading the image's own bootloader
* Grub 2 initial support has entered `live-helper` in
  commit 566d27904afb3715. Chainload the ISO from here?

frontend UI
-----------

* `live-installer` udeb and its `live-installer-launcher` desktop
  companion
* Incognito's `root_overlay/usr/sbin/create-usb` seems quite nice, as
  it allows using an existing fat32 partition, but it does not
  proposes to partition the USB device first. Their own
  [TODO](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/TODO)
  contains some nice ideas about the current topic.
* Ubuntu's [usb-creator](FIXME)
   - supposed to replicate exactly the CD to USB
   - does not seem to recognize non-Ubuntu CDs (0.1.16 crashes on
     Lenny, 0.1.10 does not display them in the GUI even if it the
     console output proves that it takes good note of their presence )
   - how does it handle partitions?
   - [launchpad](https://launchpad.net/usb-creator)
* [UNetbootin](http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/)
   - works on Windows and GNU/Linux
   - has a plugin architecture in case we need new or custom features
   - included in squeeze and sid, easily backported to Lenny
   - works like a charm to install an ISO image to USB, but the
     syslinux menu has the unetbootin logo instead of Debian's one
   - non-destructive install: does not format the chosen partition
   - **TRY ME**: from a running Live CD to USB? (seems to need to dd
     the CD to an ISO file first, which uses a lot of memory)
   - **TRY ME**: .img image to USB?
* [Ubuntu LiveUSB](http://klik.atekon.de/liveusb/)
   - (a bit too) simplistic
   - dedicated to "create a bootable Live USB medium from a running
     Ubuntu Live CD"
   - depending on sources, it partitions USB stick with one single
     800MB partition or one partition using the whole device; in any
     case, it unconditionally overwrites the device's content
   - able to upgrade without re-partitioning the device?
   - [launchpad](https://launchpad.net/liveusb)
* sidux's `install-sidux-usb-gui` needs an input ISO, but it still
  deserves being looked at more thoroughly; see the
  [manual](http://manual.sidux.com/en/hd-install-opts-en.htm#usb-hd).
* Fedora's `livecd-iso-to-disk`:
   - [manual](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FedoraLiveCD/USBHowTo)
* Fedora's [liveusb-creator](https://fedorahosted.org/liveusb-creator/):
   - works on Windows and GNU/Linux
   - "non-destructive install", which means?
   - sidux ships a modified version:
     which does not work on Lenny due to `dosfslabel` exiting with
     error code 1 even when successful
      - [.deb](http://sidux.office-vienna.at/sidux/debian/pool/main/l/liveusb-creator/),
      - [source](http://w3you.com/liveusb-creator/liveusb-creator.htm)
   - needs an ISO file, does not know how to read a real CD

partitionning

* Benjamin FOURTICQ's
  [script](http://www.mail-archive.com/debian-live@lists.debian.org/msg01832.html)
  to add a persistent home-rw partition.
