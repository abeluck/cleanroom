Getting read-write access to internal hard-disk's partitions (e.g.
Windows ones)...

* until Tails 0.6.x (based on Debian Lenny): required running commands
  as root in a terminal
* in Tails 0.7 (based on Debian Squeeze): is two-clicks away in
  GNOME's *Places* menu, thanks (?) to udisks.

Shall we consider this is a Tails bug or a feature?
