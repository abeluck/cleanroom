Since bridges are easily detected and blocked in some areas (in
particular China, but also places where wholesale SSL blocking is
used), we need to support
[obfsproxy](https://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy-instructions.html.en).

There's a Vidalia [plugin](http://gitorious.org/obfs_gui/) which would
make the configuration easier for the end user, and more easily
integrated into our current [[bridge mode|todo/bridge_support]].

Debian ITP: [[!debbug 660122]].
