Since bridges are easily detected and blocked in some areas (in
particular China, but also places where wholesale SSL blocking is
used), we need to support
[obfsproxy](https://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy-instructions.html.en).

Also, in situations where both reliability *and* obfuscation are required
despite an adversary having control of the user's local network
*traffic obfuscation* must also be employed. This traffic obfuscation
is **imperative** where the user's welfare or liberty my be
jeopardised by her use of Tor.
The [Obfsproxy](https://tails.boum.org/todo/obfsproxy/) project exists
to achieve the benefits of Tor's bridges together with traffic
obfuscation.

There was a Vidalia [plugin](http://gitorious.org/obfs_gui/) project
which could have made the configuration easier for the end user, and
more easily integrated into our current [[bridge
mode|todo/bridge_support]]; however, we're told it is stillborn.

We're said no replacement is planned. At some point TBB may ship with
obfsproxy but Tor would only launch it when you configure an
obfs2 bridge.

obfsproxy is now part of Debian.
