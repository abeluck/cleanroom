We should install [OnionCat](http://www.cypherpunk.at/onioncat) in
Tails; it should probably not be an officially supported feature to
start with, but having it available would ease the development of the
[[todo/VoIP_support]] feature.

It's not in Debian yet (ITP: [[!debbug 626380]]) but one of us will
provide a third-party APT repository pretty soon.
