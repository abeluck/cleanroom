We've been asked to include Bitcoin.

Quoting the Debian package description: "Full transaction history is
stored locally at each client. This requires 150+ MB of space, slowly
growing." => sounds like it's a job for Tails persistence support.

> booted. So, I propose *not* including Bitcoin software in Tails.
