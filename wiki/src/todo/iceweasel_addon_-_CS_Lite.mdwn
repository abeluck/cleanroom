Do we want to keep the CS Lite addon?

No other cookie manager is packaged in Debian yet. If we want to keep
it, we should package this one or similar. Someone filed an ITP for
it: [[!debbug 636399]].

Also, [Cookie
Monster](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/4703/) seems much
better than CS Lite => we asked for it to be packaged in Debian in
[[!debbug 623970]], which was ITP'd but not uploaded yet.

CS Lite features
================

- blacklist cookies by default
- ability to whitelist domains at build time
- 2-clicks to whitelist a domain / website at runtime

CS Lite issues
==============

Seems like it is unmaintained. We've had to edit its `install.rdf` to
make it work inside Squeeze's iceweasel.
