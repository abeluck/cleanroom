Template for description of settings which are needed to be requested via tails-greeter before logon:

2. default value(s) - if any
3. effects - what exactly this option will trigger (e. g. write to some file(s), exec some processes, fire d-bus signals etc)
4. ui-hint - short description to be displayed for user in order to help him to figure out how to properly set this option
5. responsible dev - contact details 
6. dev's notes - overall description from dev's point of view (why do we need this option? what are the dependencies? how do we handle it now? how do we test implementation? any other comments?)
