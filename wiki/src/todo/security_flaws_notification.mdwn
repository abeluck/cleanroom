We need a proper way to tell users that the amnesia version they are
running is affected by security flaws, and which ones they are.

A program that basically implements this is in
`config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/bin/amnesia-security-check`.

Left to do:

- run this program in `~amnesia/.config/autostart`
- make this program translatable
