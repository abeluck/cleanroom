## Current progress

0. change widget to fit many more languages: from flag icons to scrollable list - partially done (see below).
0. make .iso build - not done (see below).
0. specify dbus interface to interact with external locale-gen script - in progress (see below).
0. change widget exec order (parallel->sequential) to comply with "localization notes" part of [[todo/TailsGreeter/design]] - in progress.

## Problems

0. relocation to another country

0. rewrite d-bus handling in service.py
0. change widget exec order
0. substitute LanguageWindow widget with LangselectWindow
0. remainder of week #6 plans from [[todo/TailsGreeter/timeline]]
