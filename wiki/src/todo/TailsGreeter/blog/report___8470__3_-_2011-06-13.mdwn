## Current progress

- mostly work on university projects so minor fixes and updates only
- weekly meeting follow-up - multiple wiki updates
- review existing python code & glade interfaces
- gdm-community-greeter forked into tails-greeter
- filed RFP for gtkme [[http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=629199]] - dependency for tails-greeter
- pbuilder fix: git-buildpackage successfully builds from 'master' granch
- run community-greeter in VM: partially done - see below

## Problems

- installation into debian-squeeze is fine but got runtime error due to old python-gobject package, no backports found
- check with debian-sid is due before weekly meeting

## Near-future plans

- complete VM testing
- play with d-feet dbus debugger
- alter python code with dummy 'admin password requestor'
- check if current localization handling is suitable for tails-greeter
- make plans for next week
