- create vala code implementing [subset of] GSM's dbus interface for
  tails-greeter test interactions with real GDM (weather GDM's own
  tests or full VM)
- discuss with developers ways to better implement current items from
  "options" list - email the ML
- look at python implementation of greeter at https://code.launchpad.net/gdm-commmunity-greeter/
- try GDM's tests to run a) default greeter b) python implementation

## week #1 [1st week of June]

- reconsider implementation language e. g. vala vs python
- try GDM's tests to run a) default greeter b) python implementation
- fix git layout (remove 'upstream', move everything to 'master')
- fix project build bia git-buildpackage
- sketch-out GDM's panel dbus interface and greeter\panel interactions

## week #2 [2nd week of June]

- work on university projects - minor fixes and updates only
- weekly meeting follow-up - done
- review existing python code & glade interfaces - done
- file RFP for gtkme - done: [[http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=629199]] - done
- pbuilder fix (git-buildpackage works fine with latest 'master' branch) - done
- run community-greeter in VM - done with errors uncovered (see report)

## week #3 [3nd week of June]

1. convert tails-greeter to old-style pygtk to remove pygi dependency - in progress
2. re-test with squeeze (converted version) and sid (test  gir1.2-gtk-2.0 dependency correctness) - done, with tests failed

4.  make plans for next week - done

## week #4 [4th week of June]

1. fix errors reported by pylint
2. bump version properly (git push --tags etc.)
3. add pylint conf to ignore dbus-related false positives

5. update package(s)
6. make .iso build (if packages testing-ready)
