This page contain links to pages with all the known issues of TailsGreeter project as of GSoC completion in no particular order.

0. TailsGreeter fails to login 2nd time if user password was set during 1st login. This happens because TailsGreeter uses hardcoded login and password values. The solution could be to use GDM's AutoLogin feature. The workaround currently under development is to reset the password to default value on user's logout.
0. Language & layout panel is not autoresized correctly so some of the widgets (most notably - entry field to test keyboard layout) are beyond window borders.
0. Comboboxes with long lists are hard to use. Should be replaced with scrollable lists.
0. It's impossible to choose keyboard layout independently from the language.
0. Add helper to batch-update all the .po files
