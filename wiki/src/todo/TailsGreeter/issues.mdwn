# Bugs

## some keyboard layout choices not applied to the GNOME session

e.g. when choosing French or Italian, the GNOME session gets USA
keyboard layout.

## "waiting" mouse pointer not always displayed

## no layout for certain languages

e.g. Deutsch, Farsi, Chinese => no keyboard layout is listed.

> **release blocker** ; wait for Alan's keyboard layout rework to be
> merged before attacking it.

> in `features/refactor_languages`, the bug is in `language.py:390`
> (`get_default_layouts`)

## Keyboard layout widget not l10n'd with the selected language

Seems like all the UI's l10n is correctly updated on language change,
but the keyboard layout widget is constantly displayed using the
locale the window was loaded with.

> **Important, but no release blocker**.

* in ubiquity, the `d-i/make-keyboard-names` script uses
  `/usr/share/locale/*/LC_MESSAGES/xkeyboard-config.mo` to translate
  the keyboard layout names, from list of keyboard layouts gathered
  using the d-i's console-setup `Keyboard/KeyboardNames.pl` script
* `kbd-chooser.c` in `git://git.debian.org/d-i/kbd-chooser.git` uses
  `/usr/share/console/lists/`

## yes/no toggle buttons not translated after choosing language

The persistence and "more options" yes/no buttons are not translated
after choosing a non-English language.

> **Important, but no release blocker**

## should probably inhibit udisks while working

> **Important, but no release blocker**

## expose live-persist failure in some useful way

Currently, a GdmGreeter.errors.LivePersistError is thrown.

> **minor, postponed**

## Wrong icon used as langpanel's language label

langpanel: the icon used for the languages is "applications-internet" which
displays a globe in default icon theme, but could display something really
irrelevant in an other icon theme;

> **Minor, postponed**: we don't change the icon theme Tails uses every
> now and then.

## Scroll effect in language selection menu

langpanel: the languages menu has an horrible scroll effect at opening.
That's GTK magic that I don't know how to workaround: when poping up a
ComboBox, GTK places the selected entry under the cursor, thus not displaying
the whole menu where I want it to be;

> **Minor, postponed**: it's not perfect to they eye, sure, but it's
> perfectly usable.

# Missing features

## GUI improvements

* separator between languages list and "Other..."

> **Minor, postponed**

## Locales should be generated in the background

Once a language is selected, while the user customizes other settings,
the locales should be generated. Login should be blocked (probably
with visual indication that something is going on) until locales
generation is finished.

It's not that simple to implement: t-g is executed as 'Debian-gdm' -
it can't run localedef to generate locale; we have to weight the risk
of sudo / suid vs. the user experience benefits.

> **Minor, postponed**

## Admin password UI could be even better

Possibly hook `tails-persistence-setup`'s `update_passphrase_ui`
dynamic warning system in.

> **Minor, postponed**

## Appearance

See [[todo/windows_theme]].
