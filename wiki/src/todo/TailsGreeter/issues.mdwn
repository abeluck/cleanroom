# Bugs

## Background image should be less flashy

> **release blocker**

>> Implemented, needs to be tested.

## Replace syslinux menu

The syslinux language menu must disappear. See [[ideas on how to make
use of the syslinux menu|todo/nx_bit]].

> **release blocker**

>> Implemented, needs to be tested.

## Keyboard layout widget not l10n'd with the selected language

Seems like all the UI's l10n is correctly updated on language change,
but the keyboard layout widget is constantly displayed using the
locale the window was loaded with.

> **Important, but no release blocker**.

* in ubiquity, the `d-i/make-keyboard-names` script uses
  `/usr/share/locale/*/LC_MESSAGES/xkeyboard-config.mo` to translate
  the keyboard layout names, from list of keyboard layouts gathered
  using the d-i's console-setup `Keyboard/KeyboardNames.pl` script
* `kbd-chooser.c` in `git://git.debian.org/d-i/kbd-chooser.git` uses
  `/usr/share/console/lists/`

## expose live-persist failure in some useful way

Currently, a GdmGreeter.errors.LivePersistError is thrown.

> **minor, postponed**

## login/next button does not display the configured images

> **minor, postponed**

## Insane widgets used for long lists

Comboboxes with long lists are hard to use - should be done the same
way as GDM3 in Debian Squeeze: combobox contains default value and
"other..." option, clicking latter will bring up pop-up window with
long scrollable list of options and standard "ok", "cancel" buttons.

> * Implemented for language
> * to be done for locale and keyboard: **minor, postponed**, as those
>   lists are much shorter than the language one, so this is much less
>   of a problem.

## Wrong icon used as langpanel's language label

langpanel: the icon used for the languages is "applications-internet" which
displays a globe in default icon theme, but could display something really
irrelevant in an other icon theme;

> **Minor, postponed**: we don't change the icon theme Tails uses every
> now and then.

## Scroll effect in language selection menu

langpanel: the languages menu has an horrible scroll effect at opening.
That's GTK magic that I don't know how to workaround: when poping up a
ComboBox, GTK places the selected entry under the cursor, thus not displaying
the whole menu where I want it to be;

> **Minor, postponed**: it's not perfect to they eye, sure, but it's
> perfectly usable.

# Missing features

## GUI improvements

* separator between languages list and "Other..."

> **Minor, postponed**

## Choose keyboard layout independently from the language

It's impossible to choose keyboard layout independently from the
language. Example use-case: X needs to get his GNOME UI in Italian,
because he happens to speak that language much better than English AND
faces an azerty keyboard (e.g. because he's traveling), also he does
not know touch-typing so the keyboard physical and logical layout have
to match.

> **Minor, postponed**

## Locales should be generated in the background

Once a language is selected, while the user customizes other settings,
the locales should be generated. Login should be blocked (probably
with visual indication that something is going on) until locales
generation is finished.

It's not that simple to implement: t-g is executed as 'Debian-gdm' -
it can't run localedef to generate locale; we have to weight the risk
of sudo / suid vs. the user experience benefits.

> **Minor, postponed**

## Admin password UI could be even better

Possibly hook `tails-persistence-setup`'s `update_passphrase_ui`
dynamic warning system in.

> **Minor, postponed**

## Appearance
