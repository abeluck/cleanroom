[[!meta title="tails-greeter design and timeline"]]

[[!toc levels=2]]

Following subtasks outlined initially
===========================

#### 1)  UI design with usability in mind.

I'm no specialist in UI I'll try to keep it to bare minimum and make UI design change as easy as possible by separating related parts from the rest of the code.

#### 2) Debian packaging

.deb packages will be created once there is at least some visible code made and will be updated regularly as project develops. dpkg-divert will be used to gracefully overwrite existing greeter program supplied by gdm.deb

#### 3) i18n/l10n

This is ongoing task - all the string in project should be handled with localization in mind. Note: runtime localization itself is a separate task described in [[todo/localization_at_runtime]].

#### 4) test automation

This is optional task (if time permits). However some (unit) tests will be developed alongside with actual code to make sure that stable enough builds could be created early in the project.

## Some design decisions:

- configuration storage: gconf (with potential migration in future (after gsoc) to gsettings-over-dconf).
[reasoning: need to be compatible with current debian-based builds]

- display manager: gdm (with potential migration in future (after gsoc) to LightDM)
[reasoning: need to be compatible with current debian-based builds]

- programming language (C if gdm-simple-greeter is forked\extended or vala if tails-greeter is made from scratch)
[reasoning: use language-of-choice by gnome developers, (possibly) easier integration into build process and future maintenance]

- tails-greeter as part of dm preferred over custom dm
[reasoning: smaller amount of code, easier maintenance, easier extensibility in future (after gsoc)]
 
###  Additional notes:
1) choice of language justification: vala vs perl/python
+ more fun to work with
+ no additional runtime requirements
+ gnome's project
- less familiar

Estimated Timeline
===============

Note: this is subject to change as project develops. Major changes will be announced in mailing list and oriject blog.

## week #0 [last full week of May]

- create vala code implementing [subset of] GSM's dbus interface for
  tails-greeter test interactions with real GDM (weather GDM's own
  tests or full VM)
- discuss with developers ways to better implement current items from
  "options" list

## week #1 [1st week of June]

- create simple GUI to interact with dbus code from previous week
- sketch-out GDM's panel dbus interface and greeter\panel interactions

## week #2 [2nd week of June]

- work on university projects - minor fixes and updates only.

## week #3 [3nd week of June]

- create vala code implementing [subset of] GSM's dbus interface for panel
- test interactions with real GDM (weather GDM's own tests or full VM)

## week #3 [3nd week of June]

- extend code to make vala-greeter to handle logon process instead of
  standard greeter

## week #4 [4th week of June]

- create alpha .deb packages to test build integration and bootability

## week #4 [last week of June]

- relocation to another country
- fixes\updates\minor items which were postponed for whatever reason

## week #5 [1st week of July]

- extend code to make vala-panel to handle logon process instead of standard panel
- update package(s)
