Can you insert the freenet project for anon surfing in the next release?

>>Persistence would almost be a requirement for Freenet, and it shouldn't have to go through Tor. The reason for needing persistence is because it takes literal days to get even 30 days worth of posts from services like Frost, more if you go farther back.
>>It's bets to think of Freenet as a complex, distributed Usenet service (with the Frost program being the literal implementation). When first setting it up you specify the amount of data you wish to provide to the network, a few gigabytes worth by default, that's used as a cache to anonymously relay to other users upon request.
>>Aside from relaying data to other users, the cache is also used to index the network for both local and relaying purposes. The bigger the cache the faster a local user's network is, otherwise it's painstakingly slow, and I couldn't fathom doing it from scratch from each Tails bootup.
