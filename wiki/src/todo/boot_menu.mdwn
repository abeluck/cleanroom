While adding optional functionality to T(A)ILS, we will need a way to
ask the user for them at startup. This is for example required for
[[localization_at_runtime]], [[persistence]], [[macchanger]] and
[[bridge support]], [[include_truecrypt]].

The options chosen by the user must be available to live-boot scripts, so they
must be asked very early. This could happen either in the boot menu or by
hooking a menu that would probably run from inside the initramfs as one of the
first live-boot scripts.

# Using boot menus

In 0.6, the localisation at runtime is done in the syslinux menu for PCs, see
[[localization_at_runtime]], but it's very hard to add more than one set of
options to that kind of menu.

The only boot menu that will stay supported upstream seems to be gfxboot (to be
verified). It configuration seems however quite hard to write.

# Using a menu in the initramfs

It's probably easyer to write a nice user interface once linux is running.
However, it should be done in the initramfs as the parameters wil be used at
this stage.

## curses

It seems to be the easier way to implement it.

## graphical UI on top of the framebuffer

This seemes to be well supported by Qt:
<http://qt.nokia.com/products/platform/qt-for-embedded-linux>.

## launching X11 very early

An other option would be to start X11 very early and to run a menu under X11.
Then plymouth-x11 could be used to display a splash screen. The issue is that
it seems quite hard to start GDM in an already running X11 instance.

# Providing a configuration menu just before start desktop session

On a "classic" Debian installation, users can choose their language and
keyboard at the same time they enter their login and password in GDM.

T(A)ILS currently uses *autologin*, so these options do no usually
shows up. Hence the selection of language and keyboard very early in the
*boot* process.

But it looks like every configuration options that T(A)ILS would need do
not really require to be applied before the desktop session actually
starts.

So instead of hacking a "boot" menu, we could benefit from the flexible
architecture of GDM 3:

- Replace `gdm-simple-greeter` (the default user/login password prompt)
  by a new GTK+ application hereby named `tails-greeter`. To do so, it
  should be mostly about hacking `autostart` files.
- `tails-greeter` would display widgets and help on changing the MAC
  address, persistence, and other configuration options.
- When the *Start T(A)ILS* button is clicked, `tails-greeter` would send
  the needed D-Bus message to trigger an automatic login.
- The selected configuration will be applied within one or more scripts
  in `/etc/gdm3/PostLogin`.

Nice thing is that `tails-greeter` can probably be implemented in
Python/GTK+.

With this approach, the initial boot menu (*syslinux*) can be kept
pretty minimal and mostly offer *failsafe* boot options (e.g. overcoming
issues preventing the graphical environment to start).
