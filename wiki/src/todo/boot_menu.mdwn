While adding optional functionality to T(A)ILS, we will need a way to
ask the user for them at startup. This is for example required for
[[localization_at_runtime]], [[persistence]], [[macchanger]].

The options chosen by the user must be available to live-boot scripts, so they
must be asked very early. This could happen either in the boot menu or by
hooking a menu that would probably run from inside the initramfs as one of the
first live-boot scripts.

# Using boot menus

In 0.6, the localisation at runtime is done in the syslinux menu for PCs, see
[[localization_at_runtime]], but it's very hard to add more than one set of
options to that kind of menu.

The only boot menu that will stay supported upstream seems to be gfxboot (to be
verified). It configuration seems however quite hard to write.

# Using a menu in the initramfs

It's probably easyer to write a nice user interface once linux is running.
However, it should be done in the initramfs as the parameters wil be used at
this stage.

## curses

It seems to be the easier way to implement it.

## graphical UI on top of the framebuffer

This seemes to be well supported by Qt:
<http://qt.nokia.com/products/platform/qt-for-embedded-linux>.

## launching X11 very early

An other option would be to start X11 very early and to run a menu under X11.
Then plymouth-x11 could be used to display a splash screen. The issue is that
it seems quite hard to start GDM in an already running X11 instance.
