misc unneeded files
===================

[[!tag todo/code]]

Tails SquashFS has the files in `/tmp/`. This should not happen.
The fix should probably be implemented in live-build itself, and
pushed upstream.

live-build hooks
================

live-build 3.x ships a few interesting space-saving hooks in
`share/hooks`, such as one that removes GNOME icon cache and one that
removes compiled Python `.pyc` files.

We probably want to [[!taglink todo/wait]] for Ubuntu to actually ship
Live CDs built using live-build 3.x, before switching to it.
