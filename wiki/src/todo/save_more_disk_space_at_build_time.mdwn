misc unneeded files
===================

Current Tails devel branch cleans up `/tmp` at the end of the
chroot_local-hooks stage; before this was done, the SquashFS contained
files such as `/tmp/tmp.DO6gwUAXQz/broadcom-wl-4.150.10.5.tar.bz2`.
See released Tails 0.7.2 image for details.

We should report this as a wishlist bug against live-build itself and
possibly implement a proper fix in there (e.g. by doing this cleanup
stage before the chroot is deemed ready to be compressed, or by
mounting a tmpfs on the chroot's `/tmp` for the duration of the
build).

live-build hooks
================

live-build 3.x ships a few interesting space-saving hooks in
`share/hooks`, such as one that removes GNOME icon cache and one that
removes compiled Python `.pyc` files.

We probably want to [[!taglink todo/wait]] for Ubuntu to actually ship
Live CDs built using live-build 3.x, before switching to it.

duplicated Linux kernel
=======================

[[!tag todo/code]]

The Linux kernel + initramfs are present twice in a Tails ISO: once in
the iso9660 filesystem, once inside the SquashFS. The former is
needed, but the latter is not.

* `config/binary_rootfs/excludes` does not work, because the excluded
  files are deleted before being copied to the binary fs.
* Something along the lines of
  (`MKSQUASHFS_OPTIONS="${MKSQUASHFS_OPTIONS} -wildcards -e
  'boot/*'"`) does not work, due to [[!debbug 594968]].

=> we need to add an option to live-build that would allow us to
opt-in for "I don't want to ship the kernels and the rootfs".

files only needed at build time
===============================

We're currently using `chroot_local-includes` as a way to pass files
from the build host to the build chroot. As a result, released images
contain many files (mostly in `/usr/`) that are needed at build time
but useless at runtime.

live-build 3.x bind mounts (read-only) the build configuration
directory (`config`) inside the chroot (onto `/root/config`) while the
chroot hooks are running.
