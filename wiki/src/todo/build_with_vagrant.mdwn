[[!meta title="Build with Vagrant"]]

[[!toc levels=2]]

In order to enable more people to contribute to Tails, and to get started more
quickly, we should support building Tails in a pre-configured virtual machine
using [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/).

The on-going work is done in the `feature/vagrant` branch. **Warning**, it *will* be
rebased. To know more about its features, please have a look at the new build
documentation in there.

Left to be done
===============

[[!tag todo/code]]

Finish the build system
-----------------------

What's left:

 * Ensure we handle all VM states properly in build target.
 * Add an option to change the number of CPUs in the VM. Autodetect available
   CPUs on Linux.
 * Fail when `rake build` is run with uncommited changes. Transform that into
   a warning with then proper option.
 * Move build products in `.` instead of leaving them in the `vagrant`
   directory.
 * Call for a review on tails-dev.

Upstream Veewee
---------------

The definition for the Veewee *basebox* is fully generic for a Squeeze
installation. It should be sent to Veewee upstream.

Veewee being unusable when using `gem --user` should also be reported.
