It is really easier to maintain Debian-packaged iceweasel extensions,
rather than upgrading them in the Git-ified `$HOME`.

CS Lite
=======

No other cookie manager is packaged yet, so we should package this one
or similar. [[!tag todo/research todo/code]]

Needs:

- blacklist by default
- ability to whitelist domains at build time
- 2-clicks to whitelist a domain / website at runtime

Adblock Plus
============

Now available in Squeeze, added to install packages list; since
adblock-plus 1.1.3 is incompatible with iceweasel 3.0.6 => we now use
iceweasel from backports.org => [[!taglink todo/test]].
