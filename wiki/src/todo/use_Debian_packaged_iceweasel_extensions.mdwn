It is really easier to maintain Debian-packaged iceweasel extensions,
rather than upgrading them in the Git-ified `$HOME`.

CS Lite
=======

Is another nice cookie manager already packaged? If not, package this
one or similar.

FireGPG
=======

After a long time being unmaintained, the package has been adopted by
[dkg](http://db.debian.org/search.cgi). An updated version is now in
sid, with dependencies compatible with Lenny, so that we'll be able to
install it using pinning as soon as it enters squeeze.
