It is really easier to maintain Debian-packaged iceweasel extensions,
rather than upgrading them in the Git-ified `$HOME`.

CS Lite
=======

Is another nice cookie manager already packaged? If not, package this
one or similar.

FireGPG
=======

After a long time being unmaintained, the package has been adopted by
[dkg](http://db.debian.org/search.cgi). An updated version now lies in
the [NEW queue](http://ftp-master.debian.org/new/firegpg_0.7.8-1.html).
