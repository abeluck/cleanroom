Security bugs such as the one fixed in commit 00c1ff633e8958d0233
would be mitigated if `swapoff` was run by an init script at boot.
The relevant command line would be along the lines of:

        swapoff --all --ifexists

> The same effect has been achieved in a different way: replaced
> /sbin/swapon with a script that only runs /bin/true. Tested,
> it works, tagging [[!taglink todo/done]].
