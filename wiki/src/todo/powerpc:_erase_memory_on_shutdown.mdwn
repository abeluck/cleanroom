As reported in [[!debbug 610496]] and recently
[confirmed](http://osdir.com/ml/debian-release/2011-04/msg00044.html)
by a Debian kernel maintainer, the powerpc architecture lacks kexec
support.

Until this is fixed upstream, we should at least stop trying to run
the kexec sdmem process on this architecture.
