(As long as they are pointed to by IP rather than by hostname),
Iceweasel should allow connecting to webservers in the LAN.

# A bit of context

A workaround was available before Torbutton 1.4, that is before Tails
0.8, in the name of toggling "off" the status of Torbutton. This does
not work anymore, due to a change in the meaning of
`torbutton.locked_mode`. This change is actually welcome: with an
interface that said "Tor disabled", users were sometimes thinking Tor
was disabled, which was not really the case in Tails.

# Implementation

FoxyProxy gives us the means of a short-term solution for the "normal"
Iceweasel profile; granting direct (no-proxy) access to RFC-1918 IPs
should be pretty easy to implement using FoxyProxy:
`config/chroot_local-includes/etc/iceweasel/profile/foxyproxy.xml`.

Rationale: accessing ressources on the LAN is a usecase that can
benefit from the protections offered by Torbutton aside of proxy
settings. These ressources and/or the link to them may not be
fully trusted.
