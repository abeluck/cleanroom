Currently, Tor will not be able to setup on a network with Vidalia unless the system clock is remotely accurate.  Recently while using TAILS on an old Dell laptop, there is no way to change the clock from within Gnome and setting it with 'hwclock' does not solve the problem.  According to the documentation, if you click "Adjust Date & Time", there should be a pop-up to type in the root password and then change the settings, but currently when you click it nothing happens.

If there's another solution please let me know:
