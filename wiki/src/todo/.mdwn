Hi folks,

how about integrating the Addons UAControl, IPFuck and ModifyHeaders to the Iceweasel-Browser. 

It might also be suitable to choose a random User Agent (from a list of User Agents that're known to work without limitations) by default so people who don't know about that stuff aren't bothered with it, and those who like to tamper with it can choose to.

What do you think?
