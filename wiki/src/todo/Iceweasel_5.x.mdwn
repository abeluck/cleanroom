For various reasons, we want to ship Iceweasel 5.x or newer in Tails.

Our `feature/ff4` Git branch installs Iceweasel 5.x from the Debian
Mozilla team's APT repository.

Next things to do
=================

Extensions
----------

Some of our extensions are not marked as compatible with FF5:

- Monkeysphere 0.6 is not marked as compatible with FF5; it mostly
  works with FF5, though, as we [reported to
  upstream](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/3314) and to Debian
  ([[!debbug 638585]]). Let's fix this for real. [[!tag todo/code]]

The FireGPG extension does not work in FF4+; work [[is being
done|todo/symmetric_OpenPGP_vs_recent_Iceweasel]] to get rid of it
anyway. Let's [[!taglink todo/wait]] for that part to be finished.

Configuration
-------------

### Toolbars

It would be great to:

* Hide the HTTPS Everywhere and FoxyProxy icons from the
  Navigation Toolbar.
* Hide the menu bar (and therefore hide the bookmarks icon from the
  Navigation Toolbar).

Such settings are normally saved in `localstore.rdf`, but putting such
a customized file in `/etc/iceweasel/pref/` or
`/etc/iceweasel/profile/` does not work,  => [[!taglink todo/research]]
how to seed this aspect of the configuration for new profiles.

This is probably not blocking at all, though.
