For various reasons, we want to ship Iceweasel 5.x or newer in Tails.

Our `feature/ff4` Git branch installs Iceweasel 5.x from the Debian
Mozilla team's APT repository.

Next things to do
=================

[[!tag todo/code]]

- most of our extensions are compatible with FF4, but are not marked
  as compatible with FF5
- HTTPS-Everywhere: need to be upgraded to at least 0.9.7
- CS Lite 1.4: need to be upgraded or replaced, see
  [[todo/iceweasel_addon_-_CS_Lite]]

Blocking
========

We won't ship Iceweasel 5.x until a released stable Torbutton supports
it. Let's [[!taglink todo/wait]].

Also, FireGPG presumably does not work in Iceweasel 5.x. Let's
[[!taglink todo/test]] it.
