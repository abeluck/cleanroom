For various reasons, we want to ship Iceweasel 5.x or newer in Tails.

Our `feature/ff4` Git branch installs the current stable Iceweasel
(that is, at least 8.0) from the Debian Mozilla team's APT repository.

Next things to do

Stability
---------

I've experienced [serious stability
issues](http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-mozilla-maintainers/2011-November/011619.html).
Let's and see what the Mozilla Debian folks answer.

Note: I was not able to reproduce these bugs on bare metal.
Only libvirt/KVM seems to be affected.
Needs to be tested on more hardware.
