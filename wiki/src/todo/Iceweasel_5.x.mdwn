For various reasons, we want to ship Iceweasel 5.x or newer in Tails.

Our `feature/ff4` Git branch installs the current stable Iceweasel
(that is, at least 8.0) from the Debian Mozilla team's APT repository.

Next things to do
=================

Extensions
----------

### Monkeysphere

Monkeysphere 0.6 is not marked as compatible with FF5; it mostly
works with FF5, though, as we [reported to
upstream](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/3314) and to Debian
([[!debbug 638585]]). Let's fix this for real. [[!tag todo/code]]

### FireGPG

The FireGPG extension does not work in FF4+; work [[is being
done|todo/symmetric_OpenPGP_vs_recent_Iceweasel]] to get rid of it
anyway. Let's [[!taglink todo/wait]] for that part to be finished.
