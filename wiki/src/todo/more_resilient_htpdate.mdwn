htpdate fails too easy in paranoid mode: only one of the servers need
a problem before we fail, which has occured due to server problems twice
already (riseup and scroogle). Instead we should allow htpdate to fail for
one pool member from each of the pools (trusted, neutral and adversarial).
This incidentally requires us to add one more member to each pool compared
to what we have now.

Or even better (?), why not allow unlimited size of pools, then we
randomly pick some number (the same as now, I guess) of members from
each pool, and upon failure we pick up to one more from the same pool
for a retry. This makes it even harder for an adversary to mess with
the time.
