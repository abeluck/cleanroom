[[!tag todo/documentation]]

We could work on a section dedicated to how Tails was/can be promoted. Maybe with
the following subsections:

- Spread the word to potential users
- In the press: list of websites / papers / media where Tails was
  mentionned; also point to books/documentations mentionning Tails
- Promotion toolkit: CD jackets, leaflets, etc. (I've already felt
  the need for a small leaflet, e.g. double-sided A5, that would
  give a few hints to explain to a non-technical audience why tools
  such as Tails are needed, summarize how Tails can help solving
  issues, and point to our website for installation / usage
  documentation)
- List *common Tails misconceptions*:
  - "Tails is only meant to access the Internet"
  - Other solutions have a good chance to leave traces on hard disks
  - Tails is more that a bunch a softwares you can separately trust. That's a
    complete OS you "can trust"
  - You can use most of the software in Debian in a few clicks.
  - *And probably more*.

This section could be a first-level one ([[/promote]]) and be linked
from:

- [[contribute/how/promote]]
- homepage

A `todo/promote` tag was created.
