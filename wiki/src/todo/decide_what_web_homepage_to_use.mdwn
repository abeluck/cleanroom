iceweasel's homepage is currently set to
<https://check.torproject.org/>.

Our release process now includes quite thorough testing that makes us
confident enough in Tails configuration to instead use this very
website as the homepage.

So, we might want to use the Tails website as the iceweasel homepage,
so that users know about it and find how to get in touch, report bugs,
etc. (a bookmark to <https://check.torproject.org/> has been added in
the devel branch (commit 89d7561) to ease the transition).

Another reason to switch homepage to something else (a light
check.torproject.org version, perhaps?) is that [[the current one is
not discreet enough|bugs/Congratulations_notice.]]. The Tails website
is not substantially more discreet.
