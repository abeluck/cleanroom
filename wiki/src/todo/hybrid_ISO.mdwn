Since Tails 0.11, we stopped shipping a [[hybrid
ISO|contribute/design/hybrid_ISO]] because:

  * the new USB installer provides an alternative way to install Tails
    on USB sticks;
  * our über-weird hybrid ISO's (with recursive partition table and
    stuff) have been historically hard to boot on certain specific
    hardware, once burnt onto a CD

As a consequence, pre-UEFI Mac users who have no optical drive cannot
install Tails anymore, due to `isohybrid` being unavailable on their
system (UEFI Apple hardware apparently can't boot Tails anyway).

Perhaps we should ship hybrid ISO's again, possibly hybrid'd with the
default `isohybrid` operation mode, rather than in über-weird mode?
We should [[!taglink todo/test]] if the normal `isohybrid` operation
mode produces ISO's that boot as well as non-hybrid ones, on most (if
not all) hardware.

Alternatively, how hard would it be to provide a tiny sed or Perl
script that does the basic job of isohybrid, and could be used by
these Mac users? We should [[!taglink todo/research]] that.
