Rationale
=========

Using some kind of [[!wikipedia Mandatory Access Control]], such as
GrSecurity, AppArmor or SELinux, would make exploitation of security
issues in bundled software harder.

Possible solutions
==================

AppArmor
--------

Used in Ubuntu, now in upstream Linux kernel (>= 2.6.36, that probably
will be in squeeze-backports once Squeeze is released). Seems really
easy to write and maintain policies, many already exist.

Ongoing work to add support for AppArmor in Debian:

- ITP for userspace tools: [[!debbug 440680]]
- asking to enable AppArmor in the kernel: [[!debbug 598408]]

grsecurity
----------

[homepage](http://grsecurity.net/)

grsecurity, along with more kernel hardening features, provides
Role-Based Access Control.

Users:

- Hardened Gentoo offers a grsec-enabled kernel. RBAC policy?
- Although Liberte Linux uses PaX (Address space modification protection)
  features it does not seem to have any RBAC policy (that I was able
  to find).

- Debian Wheezy is likely to have a grsec kernel flavour available:
  [[!debbug 605090]]
- Ubuntu developers [are
  working](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/Roadmap/KernelHardening)
  to upstream grsec features mainline

SELinux
-------

Seems pretty hard to write and maintain policies.
Poor support in Debian, does not look like it's going to improve that
much.

- http://etbe.coker.com.au/2010/07/25/se-linux-status-squeeze/
- selinux policies likely won't be part of Squeeze
- GNOME, policykit, etc. are currently not supported by
  Debian-packaged policies

Smack
-----

The Smack MAC LSM is part of the Linux kernel
([homepage](http://schaufler-ca.com/), [[!wikipedia
Simplified_Mandatory_Access_Control_Kernel]]). It does not seem to be
used by any GNU/Linux distribution out there.

TOMOYO Linux
------------

Some of the TOMOYO Linux LSM
([homepage](http://tomoyo.sourceforge.jp/)) was mainlined in 2.6.30.
It does not seem to be used by any GNU/Linux distribution out there.
