please include Markus Mandalka's (privatix) usbcryptformat tool, as i find it very useful to encrypt usb sticks/disks etc, from a live system. i also think most users would find it useful as well.

> Please tell us how usbcryptformat is better than GNOME's disk
> utility (palimpsest) that is shipped in Tails 0.7.x.

>> i find g.d.u. a bit 'too much' for such a simple task, while
>> usbcryptformat is pretty straight forward with it. pick a disk and
>> crypt-format. to me it's a matter of simplicity, not
>> usability/perfomance.

same guy's cryptbackup tool, is also another wishlist for me :
link : <http://www.mandalka.name/cryptbackup/index.html.en>

> If we want to include backup software, I'd rather us include
> duplicity and deja-dup. In the current state of things, I doubt
> Tails needs a tool "to backup your home directory" (quoting
> cryptbackup's description). Anyway: please file a separate wishlist
> for backup software if you think Tails needs it since this one will
> be closed as soon as the usbcryptformat vs. g-d-u question is
> resolved.

>> you're right about this being another wishlist. so i'll not go any
>> further than just explaining why i submitted these together  :  my
>> thinking as i've been using privatix in the past, is that both
>> these tools provide -> one simple solution.  encrypt your stick and
>> keep a backup there. could be useful to some people. deja-dup would

>> backup tool.

>>p.s. thanks for such a quick response with this wishlist.
