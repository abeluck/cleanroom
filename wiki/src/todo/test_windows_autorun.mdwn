test Windows autorun (should display the included static build of this

> This does currently not work: line terminators must be CR+LF in
> autorun.inf and autorun.bat; Windows do not understand the
> content otherwise.

>> Converted line terminators in this very commit.
>> Please re-test and tag as done if it works.
