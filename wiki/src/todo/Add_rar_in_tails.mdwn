Hey Tail developers. 

Last night i d/l a rar file in tails, i was not able to open it and get its content. The included extraction tool do not support rar. And i cannot install it with apt-get install. zip works fine along with alot others. But not rar as a gui tool. I hope this can be added in the next release.
