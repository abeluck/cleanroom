It would be very nice to have (cpu) power saving enabled by default (with the ondemand governor). To enable power saving for all CPUs on multi-core machines it would also be neccessary to enable SMP support in the kernel (and also to make use of the other CPUs). Right now the power consumption with tails is way to high to be usable from a laptop computer and also unneccessarily high for a desktop computer. SMP support does not do any harm for non-SMP machines, so enabling it in the kernel config should not cause problems.
