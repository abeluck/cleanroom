Rationale
=========

 * tails-greeter exists and works (quite) fine
 * its code in not that bad anymore: now feasible to add features
 * its UI is difficult to use

We have to find a way to have an ergonomic UI.

Proposals
=========

Stop discouraging work on tails-greeter, bring positive input first
-------------------------------------------------------------------

People who have strong opinions on how t-g should work or should not,
please write this ASAP somewhere. We will start a thread on tails-dev about that.

Random ideas
------------

Some options should be probably setup differently. Typically like the language one which already has a todo item. [[todo/allow_choosing_language_at_installation_time]]

Clarify our specs and revisit past decisions
--------------------------------------------

e.g.

 * do we still want the first screen to look like a Windows (NT4) login screen?
 * do we still want a second screen for options? Or another way to show it?

Make an usability study?
------------------------

 * Draft several User eXperience (and layout) options
 * Make them testable
 * Make an usability study:
   - catch testers (Tails users and/or newbies)
   - make them test, see what they do and ask them what they think

We may want to ask input from UX experts, and/or pay one to run the usability
study.

Try something easier
--------------------

Drafting a new possible version first could be useful, and then we can decide
wether we want to ship it right away, or create other options and benchmark
them through a full-blown usability study

It's still possible to make a branch on the TailsGreeter repo and begin to
implement a proposal:

 * ask for ideas on tails-dev ML
 * propose 1 or 2 implementations
 * make "them" test and see what happens
   (other people may be able and willing to have such prototypes tested
   by first-time users, and might have himself interesting feedbacks).

The ones who draft new t-g UI may want to
have a look at gnome's studies on the subject (pages on <http://live.gnome.org>).

Pending questions
-----------------

* Do we want the look to depend on wether the Windows theme was opted-in?
* How much do we want to optimize for first-time users?

Next plans
==========

 * Do the "try something easier" way
   - ask for ideas
   - propose one or several prototypes
   - make some testing happen
   - extract something useful from the result
   - implements the choosen proposal
   Note: a developper commited to lots of thinks in that plan, but not to any dealine (not priority)!
 * If we get funding that for and it's still necessary, do the usability study


Existing work
=============

* `feature/single_toggle_button` branch in tails-greeter repo

Reports
=======

Report #1
---------

User interface is confusing.

The combination of "green/red icons + the check mark + pushed button" is
really hard to grasp.

How about a big push button labeled "Persistence", maybe with an icon?

The current behaviour for "More options?" is also problematicâ€¦ How about
having a "More options" button at the bottom, near the "Login" button?
Ideally, this would require a "Back" button on the "Administration
password" scren, but even without it, I think the result will be easier
to understand/use.

>How about using checkmark boxes or Yes/No radial dials, or not use them at all? Entering a password into a box means it's enabled, and leaving it empty implies you don't wish to use the feature. The text in my example here is a bit big though:
