[[!tag todo/website]]

I would like to edit the [[remote storage todo item|todo/remote_persistent_storage/]], but when I'm adding *one* link, I get the following error message: 

    Error: Sorry, but that looks like spam to blogspam: bayes, 8 links found

So please increase the link limit! Thanks, --mike

>>> On what page?
