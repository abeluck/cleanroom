amnesia as a VirtualBox guest
=============================

Backported VirtualBox 3.0 guest utilities, X11 drivers and kernel
modules are installed inside amnesia.

What works:

* the option to integrate the guest windows inside a X11 desktop
* kernel modules are loaded at runtime
* X11 auto-detects the VirtualBox video and input drivers
* sharing folders between a GNU/Linux host and an amnesia guest

Iff we [[decide|discussion]] to support the "amnesia as a guest inside
Windows" usecase, weâ€™ll need to test:

* desktop integration inside Windows;
* filesharing between an amnesia guest and a Windows host.
