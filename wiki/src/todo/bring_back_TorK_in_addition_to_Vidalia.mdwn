TorK had the ability to choose and exclude exit nodes on the fly
(rather than constantly rewriting an ExitNodes list by hand).

This made it much more powerful than Vidalia. Vidalia is actually
useless to me.

I understand wanting to take out KDE libraries, but if you make
Vidalia the default and I have to invoke TorK manually, then those KDE
libraries won't get called unless I demand them. There is still plenty
of room on the CD.
