What kind of additional software is needed?

Testing with Tails 12.1 I've found it was necessary to install the following set of packages from Debian Wheezy.

* libc-bin_2.13-35_i386.deb 
* libc6_2.13-35_i386.deb 
* multiarch-support_2.13-35_i386.deb 
* libpcsclite1_1.8.4-1_i386.deb 
* libccid_1.4.7-1_i386.deb 
* pcscd_1.8.4-1_i386.deb 

If Tails begins building on Wheezy, including the libccid and pcscd package should be enough for card support.
