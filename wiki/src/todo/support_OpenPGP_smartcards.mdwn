What kind of additional software is needed?

Testing with Tails 0.12.1 I've found it was necessary to install the following set of packages from Debian Wheezy.

* libc-bin (2.13-35)
* libc6 (2.13-35)
* multiarch-support
* libpcsclite1 (1.8.4-1)
* libccid (1.4.7-1)
* pcscd (1.8.4-1)

If Tails begins building on Wheezy, including the libccid and pcscd
package should be enough for Gemalto USB shell Token (A USB smart card
reader) that is popularly used with OpenPGP cards.
