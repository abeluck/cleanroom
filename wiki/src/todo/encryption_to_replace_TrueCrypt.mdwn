you say that you do not want to use TrueCrypt

Then I think that you should consider using One Time Pad encryption because it is the only encryption that truly cannot be broken or cracked.  I think that this is currently used in Pidgin and you should be able to include it easily.

also, as requested in another wish list, please give us the option to see the password when we are typing it into the password location to create keys or to decrypt files for PGP / GPG.  I also use very long passphrases of 40 to 60 characters and if I cannot see what I am typing it is very easy to make a mistake.  Also give us the option to copy and past passwords into the password location when creating keys and when we are decrypting files with PGP / GPG.

Please try to do this soon.

Everyone I know uses Tails and UPR really thanks you for your work.
