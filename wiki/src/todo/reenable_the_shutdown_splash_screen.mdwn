The shutdown/reboot splash screen was disabled by commit
cdb85d776a74e004 in order to fix
[[bugs/shutdown_splash_screen_hides_the_"you_can_halt"_message]].

This was actually a quick hack, as the real solution would be to have
`live-initramfs` to take the `noprompt` boot parameter into account
for Live USB. Bug+patch reported on [[!debbug 544901]].

Once this is fixed upstream and amnesia gets an updated package, the
splashy should be re-enabled on shutdown/reboot.
