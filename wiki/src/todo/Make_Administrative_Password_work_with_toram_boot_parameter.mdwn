Do not use the following toram boot time parameter on computers that you have access to without first waiting for comments by more experienced security and privacy experts. 

People giving the Tails 0.12 live DVD a tryout should be more interested in the product if the tradeoff described below can be resolved by enabling users to use the toram boot time command.

1) When I add 'radeon.modeset=0' (without the quotation marks) to the end of Tails' default boot menu, I am able to enter a functional administrative password in the Tails greeter that allows me to mount my internal hard disk drive and to use the root terminal, but, for example, it takes 100 seconds to open OpenOffice Writer the first time.

2) When I add 'toram radeon.modeset=0' (without the quotation marks) to the end of Tails' default boot menu, I am unable to enter a functional administrative password in the Tails greeter that allows me to mount my internal hard drive and to use the root terminal, but it only takes 20 seconds to open OpenOffice Writer the first time.

Moreover, I suspect that using the toram boot time parameter also makes other software signifantly faster.

My year 2005 vintage computer has 2GB of RAM, and an older ATI Radeon 9250 AGP video card that requires that I use the radeon.modeset=0 boot parameter in order for me to see anything on my monitor screen.
