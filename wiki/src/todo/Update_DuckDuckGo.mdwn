In Tails, DuckDuckGo comes as default in Iceweasel and you've also
added DuckDuckGo (SSL). But since we use HTTPS Everywhere these two
search plugins works the same.

I recommend you to delete them both but add these two search plugins:

<https://dl.dropbox.com/u/57167529/searchplugins.zip>

1. DuckDuckGo (Onion): http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/html/
2. DuckDuckGo (SSL): https://www.duckduckgo.com/html/

The hidden service (onion) will be much more secure than the other.

> Please elaborate why it would be much more secure.

Both of them are the non-JS version of DuckDuckGo (/html/) so works
when javascript is disabled (default won't). Different from default,
they're using method="POST" and there are no queries shown in the url
which is better for privacy.

> The `feature/better_duckduckgo` branch installs the official SSL,
> non-JS, Lite, POST version search plugin.

>> Merged into devel branch.
