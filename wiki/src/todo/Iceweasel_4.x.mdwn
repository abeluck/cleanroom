Most, if not all, of the extensions we ship are now supposed to be
compatible with Iceweasel 4.x. We should check and [[!taglink
todo/test]] Mike Homey's Iceweasel 4.x packages in current Tails to
see what works and what does not.

We also want to [[!taglink todo/wait]] for Torbutton 1.3 to be
released as a stable version so that it eventually lands into the
Debian archive.
