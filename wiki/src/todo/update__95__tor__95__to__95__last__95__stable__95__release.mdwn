The Tor project recommends to always use the last stable release, which is the 2.1 branch right now.

Tor provides versions for Debian Lenny in its own repositories. See https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian.html for details.

The new version provides improved response time for hidden services. Something really needed for [[easy encrypted bug reporting]], at least.
