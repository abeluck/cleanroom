Now that [[doc/first_steps/persistence]] exists, it makes sense to
ship a feature-full password manager: a full password management
system does a lot more than GNOME Keyring, and has more sophisticated
security features, e.g. copying masked strings, auto-lock of the db,
expiration notifications, etc.

A good password management system may be core to helping users "do the
right thing".

# Which one?

[[!tag todo/research]]

It would be great it some level of system integration was possible
(e.g. at least a taskbar icon, possibly using GTK, ideally
transparently replacing GNOME Keyring).

## KeePass

## KeepassX

## others?
