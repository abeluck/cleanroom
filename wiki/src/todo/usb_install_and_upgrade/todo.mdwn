Bugs
====

partially translated UI
-----------------------

The unified launcher is only partially translated e.g. into French:
the window title is, nothing else is.

missing correct link to documentation
-------------------------------------

The unified launched has a link to `file:///FIXME` since we don't know
the path to the installer documentation yet.

breaks emergency shutdown
-------------------------

sajolida reports:

- it seems to happen after using the liveusb-creator
- it happened on both Tails 0.10.1 and Tails experimental
- sometimes it happens while doing:
  - boot Tails experimental on a isohybrid
  - "Clone Tails" onto another stick
  - unplug the running Tails
- sometimes the screen turns black with a cursor on the top-left
  corner and nothing else
- sometimes the screen stays the same, the system is still somehow
  responsive but doesn't shutdown
- once I couldn't even shutdown with the red button or by doing `sudo
  halt` in a terminal once I reached this weird state
- once I checked and udev-watchdog was still running on the right
  device but the emergency shutdown still didn't work

intrigeri confirms: On VT1, when unplugging my boot USB stick, I see
various lines about sdb3, sdb2 and sdb1 being removed, followed by
"Bus error". Nothing more happens, and the udev watchdog process is
not there anymore.

lists devices multiple times
----------------------------

- listing an unplugged device twice or three times:
  - boot Tails experimental from a manually installed Tails
  - open "Clone Tails"
  - plug in a GTP Tails → sdc listed twice
  - unplug sdc → sdc listed three times!
- listing persistence storage:
  - boot Tails experimental from a manually installed Tails
  - open "Upgrade a non-running Tails from ISO"
  - plug in a GTP Tails → both sdc1 and sdc2 are listed twice

> **release blocker**

> 3.11.4-9 will carry a bugfix. Needs to be tested.

Report the udisks vs. partition attributes bug
----------------------------------------------

Creating or deleting a second partition using udisks resets the first partition's attributes.

Normal output is:

	$ sgdisk /dev/sdb --attributes=1:show
	1:2:1 (legacy BIOS bootable)
	1:60:1 (read-only)
	1:62:1 (hidden)
	1:63:1 (do not automount)

After creating a second partition, the output is empty.

As documented on the [syslinux
wiki](http://www.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php/Common_Problems#Missing_OS_.28gptmbr.bin.29),
trying to boot such a broken stick results in the `Missing OS` message
and no boot.

`tails-persistence-setup`, that creates the persistence partition,
workarounds this, but we must report this bug upstream.

Would-be-nice
=============

SD Card support
---------------

Maybe does not support SD / SDHC Cards as well as USB?

Unified launcher
----------------

- find 3 images for the buttons
- ship and use these images

Documentation
=============

download and installation
-------------------------

Update [[download and installation|download]] documentation.

To be treated carefully:

* The bootstrap steps (when one has no Tails system yet):  it implies
  burning a CD, booting from CD, and cloning. Or do we want to make
  a liveusb-creator `.deb` available on our website?

resetting a Tails USB stick
---------------------------

The `feature/usb_installer` branch has documentation in
`doc/resetting_usb_stick` that explains how to reset a USB stick that
previously contained a isohybrid or GPT Tails to a "normal" state
(i.e. MBR partition table, and optionally FAT32 partition).

Left to do:

* test Windows instructions
* link to these pages from the USB installer documentation

Localization
============

Hand out `.po` files to translators.

Later
=====

* Set cursor to waiting (hourglass) state while working.
* *Target Device* list: display more information, such as the stick brand and model.
* If stick is <1.5GB case, support installing but don't show the
  persistence checkbox
* Allow setting the system/overlay partitions size via command-line
  option(s).
* Add Tails to the downloadable images list.
* Allow vendors to set
  - default release to download
  - list of downloadable files
* When run from inside Tails, provide an opt-in option to download the
  ISO outside Tor.
* GPG signature verification
  - verify GPG signatures delivered with iso images (see verify_iso_sha1 called in gui.py)
  - Debian provides gpgv-win32 that can be used on Windows
- command-line option --local-hard-disks that would enable
  installation on local hard disks (= not external USB);
  is half-implemented by `--force`, see special casing in the
  detect_removable_devices method.
* currently lists all partitions on the same USB stick. What should it
  do instead?
  - if one of those partitions is labelled `Tails`, and we're
    upgrading, it probably makes sense hiding other partitions on the
    same physical device


Windows support?
----------------

As [[documented already|doc/installing_onto_a_usb_stick/windows]],
the basic Tails install onto a USB stick from Windows is already easy
to do.

Therefore, even if our installer does not run on Windows / until it
does, those who want to get a "standard" install of Tails on USB can
either burn a CD or use a "basic" install of Tails on USB, and then
run our installer in clone mode from Tails.

Proper Windows support would be welcome, though.

Try http://www.pyinstaller.org/ to create a single binary file for
Windows and for OS X. Include those binaries on Tails images?

Should be more explicit when no target device is available
----------------------------------------------------------

Empty list, no message, is not that easy to understand.
