Bug reports
===========

bug #1
------

When the --partition option is not passed, liveusb-creator must take
into account the existing Live OS will be deleted, once the user
agreed to do so:

    If you continue, this will be overwritten.
    Press 'Create Live USB' again if you wish to continue.
    Verifying filesystem...
    Not enough free space on device.
    677MB ISO + 0MB overlay > 300MB free space

Partitions
==========

- Don't ask to confirm before resetting the MBR when --partition
- if stick size <1.5GB, error out in a user-friendly way;
  bonus for later: in that case, support installing
  but don't show the persistence checkbox
- bonus: allow setting the system/overlay partitions size via
  command-line option(s)

Branding
========

- default / minimal system partition size = 1.5GB
  Put this into the config file (like branding.system_size)?
* Add Tails to the downloadable images list.
* Allow vendors to set
  - default release to download
  - list of downloadable files

GPG signature verification
==========================

- verify GPG signatures delivered with iso images
  (see verify_iso_sha1 called in gui.py)

 * Debian also provide gpgv-win32 that can be used on Windows

Misc.
=====

- UI: make it more clear when the user must confirm
  Rename the "Create" button to "Forward" or "Go on"?
  Add the "go forward" icon to the button?
- command-line option --local-hard-disks that would enable
  installation on local hard disks (= not external USB);
  seems to be implemented by --force, see special casing in the
  detect_removable_devices method.
- write a simple GUI that resets a USB stick that previously contained
  a isohybrid Tails to a sane state
  OR document with nice screenshots how to do so on GNOME / Windows


Input
=====

Test both cloning and installing from ISO while running a Tails system.

clone
-----

- GUI: hide "browse ISO file"

cloning from USB
----------------

Test on bare metal.

cloning from CD
---------------

Test on bare metal.

Distribution
============

- Debian packaging
- Windows tests

Try http://www.pyinstaller.org/ to create a single binary file
for Windows and for OS X. Include those binaries on Tails images?
