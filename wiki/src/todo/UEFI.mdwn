Some hardware ([[bugs/ThinkPad_X220_vs_GPT]], recent Mac) cannot boot
Tails from USB, due to firmware limitations. Making Tails support UEFI
would fix this problem on such hardware.

Debian unstable's Linux 3.2.16-1 kernel has "UEFI stub" support, which
allows it to be started directly since the EFI boot menu.
