Some hardware ([[bugs/ThinkPad_X220_vs_GPT]], recent Mac) cannot boot
Tails from USB, due to firmware limitations. Making Tails support UEFI
would fix this problem on such hardware.

* a recent snapshot of Libert√© Linux has added UEFI support

Debian unstable's Linux 3.2.16-1 kernel has "UEFI stub" support, which
allows it to be started directly since the EFI boot menu.

Matthew Garrett [detailed the ISO images for Fedora 17 installation CD](http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/11285.html): it supports BIOS, UEFI, Mac platforms when burned to a CD or written directly to a USB stick. This might be nice for the ISO that Tails distribute, but not applicable to support USB sticks with incremental updates.
