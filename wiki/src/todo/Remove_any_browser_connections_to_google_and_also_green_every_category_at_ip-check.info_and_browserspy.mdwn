hi, would be great if you can completely cut away any connections to google.com(maybe you already do?) but i know in Firefox there are several default settings inc. something like "safebrowsing" that sends data to google.  

Also, there are several categories at ip-check.info that TAILS is red on that can be easily fixed with about:config settings(notably "FONTS" but i think a few others are orange that could be GREEN.  maybe there's a reason that you have setup this way though? 

also, is it possible for us to import a user.js file?  i don't see any way to access the IceWeasel profile thru the Places menu but i'm kind of a noob in linux.

Also, cookie handling is kind of weak imo...on firefox i have it setup to block all cookies and then i can just whitelist where necessary with the add-on "cookie Whitelist, with buttons"...maybe its not as necessary with your system though? idk.

thanks for listening.
