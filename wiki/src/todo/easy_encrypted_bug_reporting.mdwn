Add a user-friendly way to send a GnuPG-encrypted bug report to the
amnesia dev team.

>You might want to consider adding the possibility to add logs, debugging info etc., perhaps something like this [script](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/root_overlay/usr/bin/incognito-debug) I did for Incognito. Note that that script was mostly written for my own personal usage. Scrubbing of IP/MAC addresses from ifconfig output and similar sensitive information should of course be done in order to not compromise the *real* users.


Work is in progress:

* a small pyGTK application asking very simple questions and sending
  an encrypted e-mail ([[whisperback-1.1-beta.tar.gz]]) to...
* a SMTP server behind a hidden service, only allowing to relay e-mail
  to the dev collective address

This depends on closing [[todo/include_and_import_amnesia_gnupg_key]]

Stay tuned.
