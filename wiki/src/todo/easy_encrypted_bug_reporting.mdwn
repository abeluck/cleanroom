Add a user-friendly way to send a GnuPG-encrypted bug report to the
amnesia dev team.

Work is in progress:

* a small pyGTK application asking very simple questions and sending
  an encrypted e-mail to...
* a SMTP server behind a hidden service, only allowing to relay e-mail
  to the dev collective address

Stay tuned.
