Add a user-friendly way to send a GnuPG-encrypted bug report to the
amnesia dev team.

Already done
============

* a small pyGTK application asking very simple questions and sending
  an encrypted e-mail ([[whisperback-1.1-beta.tar.gz]]) to...
* a SMTP server behind a hidden service, only allowing to relay e-mail
  to the dev collective address

To do
=====

1. copy to `config/chroot_local-includes/etc/whisperback/` the CA used
   to sign the hidden SMTP server's SSL certificate
2. solve and close [[todo/include_and_import_amnesia_gnupg_key]]
3. test! (as a WhisperBack tarball is attached to the wiki, it is
   present in generated images)
4. properly install WhisperBack inside the system, using a Debian
   package to avoid installing build-dependencies

Include additional debugging information?
-----------------------------------------

We might add the possibility to include logs, debugging info etc.,
perhaps something like the Incognito
[script](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/root_overlay/usr/bin/incognito-debug)
does.

_Nota bene_:

* that script was mostly written for the Incognito developer's own
  personal usage
* scrubbing of IP/MAC addresses from ifconfig output and similar
  sensitive information should of course be done in order to not
  compromise the *real* users.

> Agreed. I imported this script and adapted it a bit.
> 
> Pending questions:
> 
> 1. How useful would the cleaned-up `ifconfig` and `iwconfig`
>    output be? I am in favour of not including them at all, and
>    removed them from the script.
> 2. After testing this script, I can't think of any other
>    privacy-sensitive information that needs to be cleaned-up.
>    Any idea?
> 3. Should this be an option provided in the GUI? If yes, opt-in or
>    opt-out? I believe we should make this the default, not provide
>    any way to disable it, but warn the user about it and display
>    a link to inspect the tarball's content. What do you think?
> 4. What would be the files to copy on Debian instead of the Gentoo's
>    `/etc/sysconfig/*`?
