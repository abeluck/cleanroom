Add a user-friendly way to send a GnuPG-encrypted bug report to the
amnesia dev team.

Already done
============

* a small pyGTK application asking very simple questions and sending
  an encrypted e-mail ([[whisperback-1.1-beta2.tar.gz]]) to...
* a SMTP server behind a hidden service (`4mvq3pnvid3awjln.onion`),
  only allowing to relay e-mail to the dev collective address.

To do
=====

1. Fix building WhisperBack inside amnesia
        amnesia@amnesia:~/Desktop/whisperback-1.1-beta2$ ./setup.py build
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "./setup.py", line 31, in <module>
            from DistUtilsExtra.command import *
        ImportError: No module named DistUtilsExtra.command
  ... or properly install WhisperBack inside the system,
   using a Debian package to avoid installing build-dependencies
   [[!tag todo/code]]
2. make WhisperBack support checking the fingerprint of the SMTP
   relay's SSL certificate: [[!tag todo/code]]
3. write this fingerprint to
   `config/chroot_local-includes/etc/whisperback/config`
    [[!tag todo/code]]
4. Test (as a WhisperBack tarball is attached to the
   wiki, it is present in generated images)
5. make WhisperBack append the output of
   `/usr/local/bin/amnesia-debug` to the generated e-mail, warn the
   user about it and display a link to inspect the additional content.
