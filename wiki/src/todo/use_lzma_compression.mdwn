As highlighted by grml's
[documentation](http://grml.org/grml-live/#lzma-vs-zlib), LZMA
compression of the squashfs lowers the generated images' size by more
than 10%.

[[!toc levels=1]]

Current status
==============

* Linux kernel: Squashfs LZMA support is now in mainline (2.6.38-rcX)
  in the guise of Squashfs XZ - XZ is LZMA2 which is the successor to
  LZMA.
* Userspace tools: `squashfs-tools` 4.2 adds support for XZ
  compression. It has been uploaded into sid and can be easily
  backported for Squeeze until it reaches squeeze-backports.
* Debian Live: exporting `MKSQUASHFS_OPTIONS='-comp xz'` into the
  build environment (in `auto/build`) works.

=> Let's [[!taglink todo/wait]] for 2.6.38 kernel to reach
squeeze-backports.

Test results
============

Results listed bellow are the resulting ISO images size.
