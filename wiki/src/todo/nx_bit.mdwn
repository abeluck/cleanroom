The [[!wikipedia NX_bit]] helps enabling executable space protection.
Most 64bits x86 CPUs support this but T(A)ILS ships a -686 32 bit
kernel.

It seems Debian's -686 kernel does dot enable this, but the
-686-bigmem kernel might.

Beware! according to
[Wikipedia](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/NX_bit#Linux)
"the PAE mode that is required to use the NX bit causes pre-Pentium
Pro (including Pentium MMX) and Celeron M and Pentium M processors
without NX support to fail to boot"

[[!tag todo/test todo/easy]]
=> we need to build an image with `--linux-flavours 686-bigmem` in
`auto/config` and try booting it on not-so-recent hardware.
