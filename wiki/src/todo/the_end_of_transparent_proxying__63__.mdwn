Instead of transparently proxying them through Tor, we can probably
simply deny outgoing non-torified connections to the Internet, for
reasons discussed [[on the forum|forum/Tails_Fatal_Flaw..or_not??]].

Proposed course of action:

1. actually do this change in `firewall.conf`: **done** in the
   `feature/no_transparent_proxy` Git branch
2. test every application we want to access the network
  * tested ok: SSH client, wget, iceweasel HTTP, Claws Mail, Liferea,
    Pidgin, iceweasel FTP, APT, Synaptic, WhisperBack
  * left to test: Gobby 0.4, Gobby 0.5, i2p, GNOME VFS SSH and FTP,
    tails-security-check, htp
3. see what breaks, and repair
