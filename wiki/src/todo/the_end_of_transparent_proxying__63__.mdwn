Instead of transparently proxying them through Tor, we can probably
simply deny outgoing non-torified connections to the Internet, for
reasons discussed [[on the forum|forum/Tails_Fatal_Flaw..or_not??]].

Proposed course of action:

1. actually do this change in `firewall.conf`: **done** in the
   `feature/no_transparent_proxy` Git branch
2. test every application we want to access the network
  * tested ok: SSH client, wget, iceweasel HTTP, Claws Mail, Liferea,
    Pidgin, iceweasel FTP, APT, Synaptic, WhisperBack
  * left to test: Gobby 0.4, Gobby 0.5, i2p, GNOME VFS SSH and FTP,
    tails-security-check, htp
3. see what breaks, and repair

Problems:

* Since we configured apt to use polipo on port 8118 (commit dd04ca0
  in branch `feature/no_transparent_proxy`), apt will also use that
  proxy *inside* live-build after stage chroot_local-includes. This
  breaks building if the build system doesn't have a http proxy
  running on port 8118, which is quite bad. Even if one has such a
  proxy on the build system this bypasses [[build/squid-deb-proxy]],
  which is annoying and prevents offline building (unless one
  configures squid-deb-proxy to run on port 8118, of course).
