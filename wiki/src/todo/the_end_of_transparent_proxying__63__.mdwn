Instead of transparently proxying them through Tor, we can probably
simply deny outgoing non-torified connections to the Internet, for
reasons discussed [[on the forum|forum/Tails_Fatal_Flaw..or_not??]].

Proposed course of action:

1. actually do this change in `firewall.conf`
2. test every application we want to access the network
3. see what breaks, and repair
