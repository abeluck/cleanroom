Instead of transparently proxying them through Tor, we can probably
simply deny outgoing non-torified connections to the Internet, for
reasons discussed [[on the forum|forum/Tails_Fatal_Flaw..or_not??]].

This change was made in `feature/no_transparent_proxy` Git branch.

To be fixed
===========

[[!tag todo/code]]

* GNOME VFS FTP (was working in 0.9 using the Tor SOCKS proxy)
* wget FTP
* Key retrieval and searches on keyservers with seahorse and gnupg
  couldn't be tested with the default hidden indymedia keyserver as it
  seems to be down (as of 2011-12-02). Tests were successfull with
  `hkp://keys.gnupg.net`, though. [[!tag todo/qa]]

Non-issues
==========

Known issues that are not regressions:

* [[iceweasel FTP|todo/FTP_in_Iceweasel]]

Tested ok
=========

SSH client, wget HTTP, iceweasel HTTP, Claws Mail, Liferea, Pidgin,
APT, Synaptic, WhisperBack, i2p, GNOME VFS SSH, tails-security-check,
seahorse, command-line gnupg, Gobby 0.4, Gobby 0.5, htp, Iceweasel FTP
