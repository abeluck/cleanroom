As pointed out in
[[forum/Forum_Design___38___Functionality:_Primitive__44___Awkward]], our forum
can be improved in many ways.

- Allowing people to fill up an author name, even if not logged in. This should
  be possible with the comments_allowauthor option. See
  [http://ikiwiki.info/plugins/comments/](http://ikiwiki.info/plugins/comments/):

> If true (default false), anonymous commenters may specify a name for themselves,
> and the [[!meta author]] and [[!meta authorurl]] directives will not be
> overridden by the comments plugin.

- As adviced on the same page we should consider the use of either the
  `htmlbalance` or the `htmltidy` plugin. See
  [http://ikiwiki.info/plugins/htmltidy/](http://ikiwiki.info/plugins/htmltidy/)
  and
  [http://ikiwiki.info/plugins/htmlbalance/](http://ikiwiki.info/plugins/htmlbalance/).

- Ikiwiki could be improved to provide a new sort parameter to order pages by
  the modification time of its subpages. The
  [sortbylastcomment](http://ikiwiki.info/todo/sortbylastcomment_plugin/) plugin
  has been written to do that.

- If needed it should be possible to further restrict the open publishing and
  deletion on the forum by locking the forum pages so that only its author can
  edit it. Adding ' or forum/*' to locked_pages seems to do the tricks while
  still allowing anonymous users to create new threads.

- The 'Remove comment' link below each comment could be removed from the comment
  template.

Switching to a more advanced Question & Answer webapp
=====================================================

Required features
-----------------

- Allow to vote for the answers and display the answer sorted by votes.
- Allow to ask questions anonymously (possibly using a shared account with a
  public password).
- Handle karma for logged in users.
- Have decently smart email notifications.

Possible candidates
-------------------

### OSQA

- http://osqa.net/
- Anonymous posting doesn't seem possible so far. It's been a feature request
  for a while, see <http://jira.osqa.net/browse/OSQA-134>.
- Anonymous users are not yet able to vote, see
  <http://meta.osqa.net/questions/9683/should-it-be-possible-to-make-user-votes-anonymous>
- Check whether email notifications are cool enough, see
  <http://wiki.osqa.net/display/docs/OSQA+Installation+and+Upgrade+Guides#OSQAInstallationandUpgradeGuides-EmailSubscriptions>
  <http://jira.osqa.net/browse/OSQA-45>

### Askbot

- [homepage](http://askbot.org/)
- used by Fedora on [Ask Fedora](http://ask.fedoraproject.org/questions/)

### Shapado

- Seems to be a pain to install / maintain / get hosted. Ruby
  cool kids style, see Debian bug #633407.

Other issues
------------

- Do we want to have a shared "Tails" account or separate accounts per
  contributors. Keeping in mind that we want to encourage people to create
  themselves accounts so that we can vote them up or down. [[!tag todo/discuss]]

- We propose to migrate the interesting content of the forum to the new app and
  to remove the old forum from the website. [[!tag todo/website]]
