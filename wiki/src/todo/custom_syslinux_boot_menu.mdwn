Tails 0.11 boot menu says "Debian Live" and displays a big red
Debian swirl. This has two major drawbacks:

* It is confusing users who boot Tails for the first time and wonder
  why it says "Debian" while they installed "Tails".
* It is very visible to casual observers, and this happens at a time
  *before* one had a chance to enable Windows camouflage mode.

So, we would like a simple black screen with "Tails -- The Amnesic
Incognito Live System" written somewhere in less contrastish a way.

Also:

* say "Boot Tails" instead of "Boot menu"
* replace the "Debian $VERSION" from the blue progress bar by "Tails
  $VERSION"

Implementation
--------------

### To have a very simple black background

In syslinux's stdmenu.cfg

    - menu background /syslinux/splash.png
    + menu background     *   #00000000   *   *

### Instead of the black background, a splash with less contrastish tails logo

[[!img splash.png]]

I didn't found a way to add a title as text instead of as an image.

Better colors to go with that in stdmenu.cfg:

    menu color sel      *   #ffffffff   #55555555   *
    menu color hotsel   1;7;37;40 #ffffffff #22222222   *

### To say "Boot Tails" instead of "Boot menu"

In syslinux's menu.cfg:

    - menu title Boot menu
    + menu title Boot Tails

### To replace "Debian $VERSION" by "Tails $VERSION" in plymouth text

It seems that :

- "Debian" a string contained in /lib/libply-splash-core.so.2.0.0
- $VERSION is read from /etc/debian_version as stated in
  /lib/libply-splash-core.so.2.0.0

So unless we find an option to set these, changing them means recompiling plymouth.
