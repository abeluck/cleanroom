Tails 0.11 boot menu says "Debian Live" and displays a big red
Debian swirl. This has two major drawbacks:

* It is confusing users who boot Tails for the first time and wonder
  why it says "Debian" while they installed "Tails".
* It is very visible to casual observers, and this happens at a time
  *before* one had a chance to enable Windows camouflage mode.

So, we would like a simple black screen with "Tails -- The Amnesic
Incognito Live System" written somewhere in less contrastish a way.

Also:

* say "Boot Tails" instead of "Boot menu"
* replace the "Debian $VERSION" from the blue progress bar by "Tails
  $VERSION"
