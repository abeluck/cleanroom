Keys.indymedia.org has changed it's SSL certificate and does not use cacert
anymore.

For setups like Tails that don't use hkpms, it breaks the keyserver
communication.

So we have to update the configuration in Tails.

If we want to keep using hkps by default, the only option at the moment seems to
import keys.i.o new certificate in Tails. We can eventually also choose to use
the hidden service.
