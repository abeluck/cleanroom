In amnesia's usecase, leak of private information in a MUA can happen
including, but not only, via:

* outgoing EHLO/HELO SMTP commands (see [this or-talk thread about
  it](http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Aug-2008/msg00261.html))
* generated Message-ID

A quick look at the source code seems to indicate that when the
`domain` account preference is set, it is used to generate Message-IDs
and talk to SMTP servers. Not tested/sniffed yet, though.

  homepage, but it's still worth being watched for updates
