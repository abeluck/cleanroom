I need to enter some additional sign in information to even get access to the internet. I can't do that when Tor is already running.

(Also, if Tails would ever have some sort of automatic function to upgrade&update packages relevant to security during system launch, I'm not sure if that would have to go through Tor either (but that's not really what this is about; and sorry if this has been discussed already).)
