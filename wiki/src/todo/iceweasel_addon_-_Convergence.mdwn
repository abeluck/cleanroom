[[!tag todo/test todo/wait]]

Convergence ([homepage](http://convergence.io/)) is "an agile,
distributed, and secure strategy for replacing Certificate
Authorities". It seems like we should ship it at some point, as not
all Tails users will learn how to deal with [[todo/Monkeysphere]].

Reasons to wait
===============

The Tor Browser Bundle developers are [waiting for an external
audit](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.network.tor.user/20164) before
shipping it.

One of us will package and maintain Convergence in Debian (ITP:
[[!debbugs 640786]]).

Upstream [bug tracker](https://github.com/moxie0/Convergence/issues)
is a quite full of important bug reports right now. The [lack of any
SNI support](https://github.com/moxie0/Convergence/issues/28) is one
of those. Waiting for the software to mature a bit would seem sound.

Implementation
==============

What set of notaries should we use?
