It was [[pointed out in the forum|forum/Fingerprints]] that the Tor
browser probably never will include an ad blocker, like we do. See:
[2.3.5: No filters](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#philosophy)

As long as we keep an ad blocker that prevents downloading the ads our
browser fingerprint will be quite different from the Tor browser's.

We could of course remedy this by using an ad blocker which downloads
the ads but just hides the elements, but this sort of defeats what
I suppose is the main reason for us to have an ad blocker: to reduce
the lag introduced by downloading ads that usually are larger than the
target sites themselves.

>> I'm the creator of that [[forum page|forum/Fingerprints]]. I'm not an expert but this is what I see in this situation, please correct me if there are logical problems. Using ad blockers prevent ad-networks & others from tracking you. What's the problem at being tracked while you're not easily identifiable (using Tor). If you still really care about being tracked, that means you're afraid of some powerful global adversaries. And I think it wouldn't be hard for them to take fingerprints/identifiable information about you from the website/server owners etc. by looking at which websites were visited from that exit node at that specific time range. So, using ad-blockers & acting different from the default TBB settings, prevent from the ad-networks tracking you but also making you easily identifiable for the global adversaries because of your unique browser fingerprints. We should not use filter add-ons unless they are integrated into TBB too. I also don't understand how a person can really be identified as long as he doesn't enter any personal information or acts same as his non-Tor usage. So yes, I wonder, are the fingerprints really important and how can they be used to find one person. I'm confused :) Edit: Can it be like this: If I had the power, I would blacklist all IP's which are used for searching about Tor or Tails or downloaded Tails for example. Because it's simple, until you find Tor&Tails probably you didn't use anonymizers or if you used, they could still take your IP from the proxy owners too. As long as Tails' fingerprints differ from TBB, if someone found to be using Tails (no ads, different headers, screen sizes, etc.) there will be far fewer targets for them to look at. It would be nice if there was a detailed list of examples about how can someone's identity get compromised while using Tor (on the Tor Project website)

> There is no point in blindly copying TB just because everyone else slavishly wants the same fingerprint. What if TB is (repeatedly) making the wrong decisions? If there are enough Tails users it wouldn't matter if their fingerprint is both unique and different from TB but all Tails users got exactly the same fingerprint. The real reason TB doesn't include an Adblocker is political, given Tail is somewhat an officially supported or endorsed project I'm expecting it to follow suit.

>> Thank god you're not a Tails developer. There's nothing about slavishness, if we are all using Tor and Tails for anonymity-privacy we should do our best at it. What's wrong with better privacy? Why are you using Tails? Look at the Tor website, the idea is simple. More people using Tor, more anonymous you are. With every different fingerprint you have, you're just choosing less people to hide between, so worse annonymity.
Isn't unlinkability or privacy one of the main purposes of the Tails project? What Tails doing now is to make it easier to link your different activities. I really don't get the point why there is an ad-blocker. Could you please tell me the benefits of using it? (Except faster web experience)

>>> My question was, what if Tails is right and TBB is wrong (technically, not ideologically or politically). Shouldn't you be at trac.torproject.org and complain that *their* fingerprint is different from Tails. I'm not suggesting that this is definitely the case. I'm just throwing this question in here to discuss it.

>>>> "What if"? If you think there's something wrong with TBB just show it. Also, I didn't say there's something technically wrong in Tails. What I say is, we should be between the biggest group of users. We shouldn't limit our anonymity set. And all my suggestions are at the bottom of this page. Anything wrong with TBB'S accept headers?, default screen size? Or is it the ad-blockers? Please read the design document from the links.

>>> Privacy is totally unrelated from unlinkability. The better term to use here would be "anonymity set reduction". Reduction is always bad, it lessens the quality of anonymity. Ideally all Tor users would have the same fingerprint. But the anonymity set isn't the only criteria and if the Tails set is large enough and there are good reasons to deviate from TB this trade off could improve the overall anonymity. One such tradeoff (between anonymity set and security) worth making would be disabling JS by default, but then there is the tradeoff between usability and security to consider as well! 

>>> You made it sound like these are easy decisions. I hope I could explain why they are not.

>>>> Are you talking about removing adblock? If there's something logically wrong with the TBB Design, please tell us.

>>**To developers:** Please look at the [latest comments about Fingerprints](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Fingerprints/) Please especially read these parts of Design document: [1](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#fingerprinting) - [2](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#fingerprinting-linkability). What I currently see is, 1- different default screen size (1000x500 on TBB), 2- different accept headers and 3- Adblock Plus. Maybe you should contact Tor developers about these issues.
