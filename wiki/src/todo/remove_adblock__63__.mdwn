It was [[pointed out in the forum|forum/Fingerprints]] that the Tor
browser probably never will include an ad blocker, like we do. See:
[2.3.5: No filters](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#philosophy)

As long as we keep an ad blocker that prevents downloading the ads our
browser fingerprint will be quite different from the Tor browser's. We
could of course remedy this by using an ad blocker which downloads the
ads but just hides the elements, but this sort of defeats what I
suppose is the main reason for us to have an ad blocker: to reduce the
lag introduced by downloading ads that usually are larger than the
target sites themselves.
