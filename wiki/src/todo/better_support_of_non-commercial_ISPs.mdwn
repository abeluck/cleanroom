Non-commercial, ethical ISPs, such as the one who signed the
[data retention manifest](http://www.nadir.org/nadir/aktuell/2008/10/10/36282.html),
need to be better supported by amnesia:

* install the SSL certificates/CA for such servers
* add bookmarks to the above-mentioned servers, in particular for
  quick'n'easy webmail access
* easily build a live system with a custom JavaScript/cookies
  whitelist; until this is done, add a few of the more trustworthy
  servers to the whitelist (for cookies, this is configured in
  `chroot_local-includes/usr/share/amnesia/iceweasel/sql/permissions.sql`)
