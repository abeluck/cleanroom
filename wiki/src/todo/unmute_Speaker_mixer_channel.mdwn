Linux 3.2 adds a "Speaker" channel for some sound cards.

> That channel has been there since forever for some cards.

The Debian Alsa initscript unmutes only a few channels. In alsa-utils
1.0.23-4 and later, the Speaker channel is unmuted.

Tails 0.10.x has been shipping alsa-utils 1.0.23-3, which mutes the
Speaker channel. A user have been complaining about this, as Tails
effectively mutes their sound card at boot time: [[!debbug 603550]].

We need to patch `/usr/share/alsa/utils.sh` the same way alsa-utils
1.0.23-4 and later do.

>> I'm the bug reporter, you set the "Speaker" volume as 80%. Doesn't this mean 80% master x 80% speaker = 64% total volume? If I didn't get it wrong it should be same for Headphones (80% x 80% = 64%). If so, please set the other channels at maximum and decrease the master if needed so we could change the volume only by controlling the master channel
