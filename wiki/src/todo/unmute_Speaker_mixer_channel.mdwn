Linux 3.2 adds a "Speaker" channel for some sound cards.

> That channel has been there since forever for some cards.

The Debian Alsa initscript unmutes only a few channels. In alsa-utils
1.0.23-4 and later, the Speaker channel is unmuted.

Tails 0.10.x has been shipping alsa-utils 1.0.23-3, which mutes the
Speaker channel. A user have been complaining about this, as Tails
effectively mutes their sound card at boot time: [[!debbug 603550]].

We need to patch `/usr/share/alsa/utils.sh` the same way alsa-utils
1.0.23-4 and later do.
