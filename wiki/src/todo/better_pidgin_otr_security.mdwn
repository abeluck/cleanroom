We need to only allow OTR protocol v2 and later, to circumvent the
protocol version negotiation attack described in [Finite-State
Security Analysis of OTR Version
2](http://www.jbonneau.com/OTR_analysis.pdf) ... until the protocol +
libotr themselves are fixed.

0. Ask on otr-dev why the protocol hasn't been updated since the
   publication of the aforementioned paper, especially wrt. the
   protocol version attack. [Done on
   2012-05-07](http://lists.cypherpunks.ca/pipermail/otr-dev/2012-May/001301.html).

1. See how to fix upstream code if it's not done yet.
