Tails 0.10 time setting process (tordate, htpdate) changes the
hardware clock.

Changing the hardware clock is a change to the hardware, and as such
goes against the whole "let's not leave any traces on the hardware
unless the user OKs it" thing.

Tails should avoid doing this:

* either change the system time without changing the hardware clock
* or reset the hardware clock, at shutdown time, to the the old
  time offset
