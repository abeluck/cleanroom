As mentioned on the forum in
[[/forum/using_DownThemAll___40__iceweasle_firefox_addon__41__]], it
might be useful to include a download managar in Tails.

A usecase could be to try to download a big file across separate working
sessions.

If so, [uget](http://urlget.sourceforge.net/) could be a good candidate.
