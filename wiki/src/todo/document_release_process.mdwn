Testing
=======

Until [[automated_tests]] are setup, some minimal, manual testing has
to be done by the person doing the release, in addition to the
real-world tests done by fellow beta-testers:

* iceweasel: is web browsing really torified?
* pidgin: is an IRC session really torified?
* firewall: is the Tor-enforcement effective?
* local partitions: are any local hard-disk partitions mounted or used
  as swap?

Torrents
========

The resulting installed packages list is exported at build-time to
a plain-text file that could be published along with the prebuilt
images / torrent files, so that one can have a look at it without
needing to {download,build} and boot amnesia.

Such a list should be linked from [[features]] when a new amnesia
release is available via bittorrent.

Add symlinks with persistent names to the latest available `.torrent`
files (Git and/or latest tagged stable release?).

These links should be published via https.

published `.torrent` files should have
<http://z6gw6skubmo2pj43.onion:8080/announce> as an additional
announce URL.
