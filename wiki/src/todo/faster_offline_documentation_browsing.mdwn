Tails's offline documentation via Yelp is slow.
This should be fixed. How?

>> Is check.torproject.org as a startpage realy required? Perhaps we can ship an offline page pointing to the documentation, adding eventually a link to Torcheck.

> As a temporary half-solution, [Tails 0.12](git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=blob_plain;f=debian/changelog;hb=refs/tags/0.12) includes an iceweasel's bookmark poiting to the offline documentation

Research
========

Yelp seems to scan and index stuff at 1st startup: <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=388263>. This is solved by yelp 2.31.1, which is not in squeeze.

Opening the offline documenation page as a homepage in iceweasel conflicts with the
decision to have the Tails "News" page as a homepage.

Possible solutions:

 - fix iceweasel bug [[bugs/iceweasel_1st_page_not_loaded]]
 - backport the patch that fixes this issue to squeeze Yelp... But I can't find this
   patch. And is it possible to include it in debian?
 - use a dedicated help browser before we use wheezy? There is one in WhisperBack, it's 
   few lines of Python code with WebKit (and easy to launch a true webbrowser for
   non-local files)
