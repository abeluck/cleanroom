Many ISPs now have a large number of "free" WiFi access points based
on the modem/router boxes they install at their customers home.
Examples: FreeWifi, NeufWifi, Fon, probably others worldwide.

A lot of these run a captive web portal (often using a
catch-all-DNS-requests system) where potential user can authenticate.

Such hotspots are pretty useful but currently unusable in T(A)ILS due
to DNS torification and Tor enforcement.

We should implement a way to fix this.
