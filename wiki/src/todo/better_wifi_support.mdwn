Installing a bunch of firmwares is not enough to properly support most
wifi cards. See `all_chroot_rt2570-modules.sh`,
`lenny_chroot_madwifi-modules.sh` `all_chroot_rt2570-modules.sh` in
the `examples/hooks/` directory of the `live-helper` repository for
additional wifi modules support.

We could take a look to the Debian Backtrack work around wifi and patches for injection.

> We now build rt2570 modules, untested yet => [[!taglink todo/test]].
