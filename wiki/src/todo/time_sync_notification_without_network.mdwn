Commit 2575a78 from merging in the feature/tordate branch made the
time sync notification start earlier than before. An unintentional
consequence of this is that it's shown even when booting Tails
without a network connection. This should not be the case.

> Implemented in bugfix/time_sync_notification
> [[!taglink pending]] for Tails 0.11 or 0.10.3 (whichever comes first).
