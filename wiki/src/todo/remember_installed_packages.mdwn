When user have enabled persistence, it could be nice to remember which
extra packages they have installed. Either in the greeter or upon login, an
interface could appear offering the user to select which packages should be
reinstalled (all unselected by default).

Having this choice in the greeter could allow users to install their preferred
software without having an administrative password set.

The security implications of this whole idea needs to be researched before
diving in the code.
