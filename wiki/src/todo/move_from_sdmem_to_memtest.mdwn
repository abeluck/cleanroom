Rationale
=========

Replace sdmem with the Linux kernel's `memtest=2` feature will fix
[[bugs/sdmem_does_not_clear_all_memory]] and will generally be simpler
and more robust.

> Update: `memtest=` does not test all memory, so it's not fit for any
> kind of anti-forensics memory wiping. Being discussed on tails-dev,
> end of 2011.
