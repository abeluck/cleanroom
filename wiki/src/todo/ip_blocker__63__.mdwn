was wondering if its possible to add some kind of ip blocking program that would allow us to block known gov't IP's, malware IP's, tracking company IP's etc.  (PeerGuardian, PeerBlock, etc)

i'm not sure if this is feasible or even desirable for most users of TAILS but its an option i'd like to see added.

Thanks.
