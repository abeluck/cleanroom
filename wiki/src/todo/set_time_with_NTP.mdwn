On the one hand, Tor sometimes freaks out if it detects a too large
clock skew. On the other hand, having the desktop environment display
localized time would be a nice bonus.

Implementation
==============

We should set the system time with NTP during boot.

This will require adding a rule for the user/group used by the chosen
NTP software to bypass Tor forwarding in the firewall.

The OpenBSD NTP daemon seems like a nice and trustworthy
implementation of the NTP protocol; it is
[packaged](http://packages.debian.org/lenny/openntpd) in Debian Lenny.
