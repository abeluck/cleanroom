WhisperBack SMTP relay is too often down, while we have two instances,
including one on a stable server.

We should now:

* Finish configuring our second relay.
* Make sure the "second" relay takes over the service when the
  previously active one is up. Hopefully, Tor hidden services don't
  provide this free fail-over functionality. Else, a stupid cronjob to
  restart Tor when needed should do the job.
