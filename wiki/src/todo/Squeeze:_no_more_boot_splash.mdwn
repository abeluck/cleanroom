Splashy was removed from testing and won't be part of the Squeeze
release. The reasons for this removal (see [[!debbug 599245]]) are not
of the kind we can afford ignoring (incompatible with KMS, progress
bar broken with new parallel dependency-based init system, dead
upstream).

We then need to choose amongst the following solutions:

- switch to another boot splash system (plymouth? seems a bit too
  buggy to be shipped on a LiveCD)
- forget the boot splash thing until a maintainable solution arises
  (could be affordable as GDM now starts quite earlier)

The [[todo/windows_theme]] task would be improved by a graphical
Windows splash screen.

Update: according to dba, the simple Plymouth blue progress bar
(ascii, no drm) is working absolutely everwhere, he's not found one
machine not supporting it, yet. For squeeze-based systems,
progress-linux just installs the [[!debpkg plymouth]] package and
that's all. Once the level of broken hardware has dropped
significantly, which probably is when wheezy is due, a clean looking
graphical splash can be shipped with DRM support.

Quickly implemented in `feature/plymouth`.

Testing
-------

[[!tag todo/test]]

We now need to test it with various hardware, some that uses KMS by
default on Squeeze and some that does not.

Works on:

 - Thinkpad X32 (radeon, kms enabled)

Does not work on:
