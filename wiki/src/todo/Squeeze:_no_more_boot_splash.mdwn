Splashy was removed from testing and won't be part of the Squeeze
release. We need to investigate whether the reasons for this removal
([[!debbug 599245]]) affect T(A)ILS, and choose amongst the following
solutions:

- ship a custom Splashy package built for Squeeze
- switch to another boot splash system (plymouth? seems a bit too
  buggy to be shipped on a LiveCD)
- forget the boot splash thing until a maintainable solution arises.
