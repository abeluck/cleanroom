I couldn't find place where it is possible to allow JavaScript for specific sites. I'm using Firefox with JavaScript disabled, but it would be very useful for me to enable JavaScript for few trusted sites, which doesn't work fully when JavaScript is disabled. It is possible to switch JavaScript on and off globally via preferences, but it is not user friendly way. Maybe something like NoScript Firefox addon?
