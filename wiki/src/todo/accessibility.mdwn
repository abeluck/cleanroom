# Rationale

Tails should be usable by every [[target user|contribute/design]],
regardless of their abilities or inabilities. Only other key
requirements of [[Tails design|contribute/design]] (such as Free
Software and maintainability) shall limit this one.

Tails therefore needs to ship with accessibility technologies.

# Visual

## Enabling it

- [[!taglink todo/research]] how these accessibility tools can be
  enabled at boot time by people who need it; e.g. is there an option
  that can be passed to `live-config` on the kernel command-line to do
  so?

## Basic tools

- install `dasher` (graphical predictive text input system) [[!tag todo/code]]
- screen magnifier: `gnome-mag` is installed in the devel branch,
  needs [[!taglink todo/test]]
- text-to-speech: `gnome-orca` is installed in the devel branch,
  needs [[!taglink todo/test]]

## Compiz

We have been told that Compiz is the preferred accessibility solution
for some people with sight impairment; such features Compiz includes are:

- inverting colors: good for the color blind or those who need better
  contrast
- looking glass: (small area of screen enlarged) good for those who
  still like to see the whole desktop while working. This one provides
  some nice graphics too.
- magnifier: like looking glass but without the other graphics
- sharpen: makes the entire desktop look sharper for better readability
- track mouse: (very helpful) it is very easy for a sight impaired
  person to loose their mouse. this feature helps prevent that. This
  is much clearer cut than the mouse tracking in gnome-mag.
- zoom: magnify the entire desktop

On the other hand, Compiz requires modern graphics hardware, and seems
pretty hard to get working on Debian Squeeze. We should [[!taglink
todo/test]] and [[!taglink todo/research]]:

- if there is a way to have Compiz properly working on Debian Squeeze;
- if there is a practical way to enable Compiz automatically on
  hardware that supports it.
