[randomsound](http://www.digital-scurf.org/software/randomsound) ([in
Lenny](http://packages.debian.org/lenny/randomsound)) greatly enhances
the kernel entropy pool, which is nice since:

* software bundled with amnesia heavily use cryptography and therefore
  the kernel PRNG / entropy pool
* the amnesia running system state is quite predictable, which is Badâ„¢
  for PRNG / entropy pool

This package only depends on `alsa-utils`. Is it already pulled-in as
another package's dependency?
