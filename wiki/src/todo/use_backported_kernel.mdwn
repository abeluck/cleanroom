The kernel from Debian Squeeze is usually backported and uploaded
quite fast to <http://backports.org> by members of the Debian kernel
team. Using them, until Lenny-and-an-half is released, would help
supporting newer hardware.

amnesia already fetches some packages from <http://backports.org>, so
this should be quite easy to implement.
