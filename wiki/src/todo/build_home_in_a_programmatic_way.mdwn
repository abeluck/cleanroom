iceweasel
=========

## default profile in `/etc/iceweasel/profile/` rather than in `$HOME`

### pros

* some files seem easier to configure there, e.g.
  `/etc/iceweasel/profile/bookmarks.html`
* no need to resync `$HOME` every time a Debian packaged extension is
  upgraded, in order to avoid the annoying "an extension has been
  upgraded" dialog box
* forces us to configure iceweasel in a fully programmatic way

### cons

### to check

* were do we put extensions that aren't Debian-packaged?

## NSS *.db files

* `cert8.db`: could be generated from scratch by adding our few custom
  SSL root certificates with `certutil`
* `secmod.db`: if this file is missing, a new one is generated without
  DSA, SHA256 and SHA512; weird.
* `key3.db`: if missing, the other `*.db` files can't be used

## sqlite

Most sqlite files could be built from scratch with SQL commands.

Bookmarks are the only pieces of data we want to preserve in
`places.sqlite`; according to
[MozillaZine](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Places.sqlite), a missing
`places.sqlite` is rebuilt using the latest dated JSON file from the
`bookmarkbackups` folder. We could then store our bookmarks data as
a backup, and rm+exclude `places.sqlite`.

## resources

- [TBB's build
  scripts](https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torbrowser/trunk/build-scripts/)
  do a bunch of things that can be very interesting for us

Gnome
=====

[Sabayon](http://live.gnome.org/Sabayon/) is "a system administration
tool to define and deploy desktop profiles for the GNOME
desktop environment." It may very well be fit our needs, but
it is currently (20100213) only available in Debian experimental
(which is explained by [[!debbug 534941]]).

## panel

- use `gconftool --load`
- see `/usr/share/gconf/defaults/05_panel-default-setup.entries`
