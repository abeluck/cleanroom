iceweasel
---------

### default profile in `/etc/iceweasel/profile/` rather than in `$HOME`

#### pros

* some files seem easier to configure there, e.g.
  `/etc/iceweasel/profile/bookmarks.html`
* no need to resync `$HOME` every time a Debian packaged extension is
  upgraded, in order to avoid the annoying "an extension has been
  upgraded" dialog box
* forces us to configure iceweasel in a fully programmatic way

#### cons

#### to check

* were do we put extensions that aren't Debian-packaged?

### NSS *.db files

* `cert8.db`: could be generated from scratch by adding our few custom
  SSL root certificates with `certutil`
* `secmod.db`: if this file is missing, a new one is generated without
  DSA, SHA256 and SHA512; weird.
* `key3.db`: if missing, the other `*.db` files can't be used

### sqlite

Most sqlite files could be built from scratch with SQL commands.

Bookmarks are the only pieces of data we want to preserve in
`places.sqlite`; according to
[MozillaZine](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Places.sqlite), a missing
`places.sqlite` is rebuilt using the latest dated JSON file from the
`bookmarkbackups` folder. We could then store our bookmarks data as
a backup, and rm+exclude `places.sqlite`.
