A set of boot splash screen / Desktop theme / iceweasel theme that
mimic Microsoft Windows and Internet Explorer would be nice when using
a public computer in order to raise less suspicion.

The Tails boot splash screen should be black with a tiny dots-based
progress bar. Later on in the boot process, tails-greeter would
provide a way to optionally start the GNOME session with a Windows
look-alike theme; the Windows look would be the auto-selected default
in case a Windows OS is detected on fixed disks. Users could make this
setting persistent when using persistence. tails-greeter should look
like Windows login screen (best would be to look like Windows XP, but
looking like Windows NT4 login screen would be an acceptable, much
easier, first implementation step).

# Next things to do

Look at what Windows XP, Vista and Seven look like and [[!taglink

## XpGnome

[homepage](http://ubuntu.online02.com/node/14)

- tested, works well in 0.7
- 1.2MB compressed once the duplicated files are removed from the
  tarball
- bugs:
 * mouse-on-dropbox => invisible text
 * marked item that looses focus => invisible text
 * probably more

### Debian package

There is a Debian package [available](http://thinetic.com/debian/) but
it is in a terrible state: it uses an Xsession.d script for activating
the theme, and it's only acivated if /etc/default/xpgnome has
XPGNOME_START set. The problem is that X has to be started with this
*twice* for the theme to actually be set. And once it's done, some
things are localized to Spanish (e.g. "My computer" -> "Mi
PC"). Furthermore the packaging is really bad: the files in the debian
directory are not set up properly, and all source files are included
in it, not in a separate archive.

### XpGnome contents

XpGnome uses three packages from GnomeLoop.org:

* [XPLuna](http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/XPLuna?content=83797)
  for a Windows XP look for windows, panel, backgroup etc.
* [GnomeXP](http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/GnomeXP?content=69587)
  for Windows XP icons.
* [Cursor XP](http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Cursor+XP?content=77833)
  for a Windows cursor.

Except installing these XpGnome's installation script also uses gconf
to fix some further issues (desktop icons, panel etc.).

### Plan for integration

1. We do some (trivial) packaging ourselves, one for each of the
   GnomeLoop.org packages listed as XpGnome's contents above.
2. We cut out the parts of the XpGnome installation script which sets
   up the theme and put that in a script of our own and just make it a
   local-include.
3. This script will be run as the amnesia user if whatever condition
   we chose is true before X starts, e.g. "winxp" on cmdline for now,
   later some setting in tails-greeter.
