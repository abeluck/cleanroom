Please set the following typical aliases in tail's user shell:

alias mv="mv -i"

and also possibly

alias cp="cp -i"

The first is very important. I've already had one disaster on the commandline with mv because, unlike my other systems where this alias is set (many systems ship with it), on tails mv just overwrites without prompting!
