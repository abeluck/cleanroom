The [Monkeysphere](http://web.monkeysphere.info/) project now seems to
propose a working infrastructure (validation agent, Iceweasel plugin)
for validating HTTPS certificates using the GnuPG web-of-trust.

We now install `monkeysphere`, `msva-perl` and `xul-ext-monkeysphere`
into the system. Time to [[!taglink todo/test]]!
