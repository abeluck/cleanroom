Having a PO file editor in T(A)ILS would be a huge bonus e.g. for
contributors who want to translate this very wiki or other T(A)ILS
specific software.

Likely candidates are:

- poedit: multi-platform (7.6MB added to the chroot size)
- Gtranslator (2.5MB added to the chroot size)

We should [[!taglink todo/research]] which one is the best / popular /
preferred.
