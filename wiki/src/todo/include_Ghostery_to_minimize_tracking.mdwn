[Ghostery](http://www.ghostery.com/) can be set in a quiet mode that
does not constantly alert the user to tracking software, but will
simply block connections to third-party trackers.

Third-party trackers, of the type that Ghostery fights, make it much
easier to follow a Tor user across the Internet. They are installed on
almost every website now, everywhere. The security implications are
obvious.
