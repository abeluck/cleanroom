NetworkManager 0.6, the branch shipped with Debian Lenny and the
current amnesia is not able to use static IP addresses.

The 0.7 branch added support for static IPs. As it has been
uploaded to lenny-backports, pining has been configured.

**TODO**: is it necessary to set to `managed=true` in the `ifupdown`
section of `/etc/NetworkManager/nm-system-settings.conf` for this new
version to properly work?
