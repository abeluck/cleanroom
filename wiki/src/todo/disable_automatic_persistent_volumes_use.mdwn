As explained in the
[section about persistence](http://live.debian.net/manual/html/persistence.html)
in the Debian Live manual, "If during the boot a partition
(filesystem) image file or a partition labeled home-rw is discovered,
this filesystem will be directly mounted as /home".

This is a security issue for amnesia users because:

1. The `home-rw` or `live-rw` volume found on the local hard-disk may
   be malicious.
2. As specified in [[todo/persistence]], write access to a persistent
   storage volume must require a voluntary user action.
