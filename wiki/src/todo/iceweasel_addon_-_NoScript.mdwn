This is what's said about [NoScript](http://noscript.net/) in the [Torbutton FAQ](https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/torbutton-faq.html.en#recommendedextensions):

> Torbutton currently mitigates all known anonymity issues with Javascript. However, if you are concerned about Javascript exploits against your browser or against websites you are logged in to, you may want to use NoScript. It provides the ability to allow Javascript only for particular websites and also provides mechanisms to force HTTPS urls for sites with insecure cookies.
> It can be difficult to configure such that the most sites will work properly though. In particular, you want to make sure you do not remove the Javascript whitelist for addons.mozilla.org, as extensions are downloaded via http and verified by javascript from the https page.

This might be useful for more advanced users that want additional privacy. Given how widely used this addon is by said user group it seems likely that any incompatibilities with other addons we use should('ve) be(en) identified and fixed quickly.

Configuration
=============
Since this plugin will confuse the uninitiated, and since Torbuttin already blocks all known JavaScript issues, NoScript should be configured to allow all sites per default. It's either up to the user to blacklist domains, or disable all sites per default and then whitelist the ones deemed trustworthy.
