Rationale
=========

In addition to [[ship Vidalia instead of TorK]], we need to find and
install a great non-KDE virtual keyboard in order to stop installing
KDE libraries.

Previous research was unsuccessful, but things may have changed in
the meantime.

Implementation
==============

kvkbd
-----

* automagically guesses the (localized) keyboard layout from the
  current X config
* needs KDE libs

onBoard
-------

* shipped by Ubuntu
* no keyboard layout dynamic learning? a
  [bug report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/onboard/+bug/65626) tends to
  indicate the contrary; this should be investigated further.
* hard to built for Debian Lenny, as it depends on `python-gconf` that
  itself depends on newer `python-gnome2` and `libgconf2-4` packages
