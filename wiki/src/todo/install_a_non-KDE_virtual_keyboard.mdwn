Rationale
=========

In addition to [[ship Vidalia instead of TorK]], we need to find and
install a great non-KDE virtual keyboard in order to stop installing
KDE libraries.

Previous research was unsuccessful, but things may have changed in
the meantime.

Implementation
==============

kvkbd
-----

* automagically guesses the (localized) keyboard layout from the
  current X config
* needs KDE libs

[onBoard](http://launchpad.net/onboard)
-------

* shipped by Ubuntu
* keyboard layout dynamic learning : 
  [bug report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/onboard/+bug/65626) ;
  in squeeze it uses the localized layout
* there is a notification area icon
* hard to built for Debian Lenny, as it depends on `python-gconf` that
  itself depends on newer `python-gnome2` and `libgconf2-4` packages

[matchbox-keyboard](http://matchbox-project.org/?p=1)
-----------------

* packaged for lenny
* misses a gnome panel applet/notification area icon, but it shouldn't be a lot to write, as there is one for matchbox panel provided
* here is a french layout : [[keyboard-fr.xml]]



gok
---

* was not able to get it working


xvbkd
-----

* no dynamic layout loading
* quite ugly
