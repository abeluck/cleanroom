For discretion matters, we've been suggested to disable the PC speaker
beep.

As [documented in the Debian
Reference](http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch09.en.html#_disabling_beep_sounds),
the standard way to do so is to remove / blacklist the `pcspkr`
kernel module.

But this is more complicated than this. More to come.
