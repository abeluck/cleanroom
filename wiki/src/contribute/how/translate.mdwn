<p>You want to make it easier to use Tails in your own language.
Welcome aboard!</p>

For English native speakers
===========================

Most of Tails' developers are not native English speakers so you're also more than
welcome to edit, rephrase, correct or improve our English. Since you won't be
able to use translation tools for that but rather edit the original code or wiki
pages your best option will be using the web interface to the wiki or
Git to submit patches.

Translating Tails
=================

If you are a native speaker of one of the languages available on this website,
you can work on correcting, improving or completing the translations that are
already available in Tails.

The following things need to be translated:

  - Our [[custom programs|contribute/git]]: Tails Greeter, Tails
    Persistence Setup, Tails USB Installer, Whisperback, etc.
  - Our website.
  - The other texts that might be listed in the *Translate* section of
    the [[/todo#translate]] list.

The internationalization system used by both the custom programs and the
website is called <span class="application">[[!wikipedia
gettext]]</span>. When using <span class="application">gettext</span>,
the translations for each bits of text are written in PO files.

To edit PO files we recommend you to use <span
class="application">[Poedit]</span> a cross-platform editor for PO
files. <span class="application">Poedit</span> is installed in Tails.

The tails-l10n Mailing List
===========================

Regular translators and translating teams coordinate themselves on the
tails-l10n mailing list. Please <a
href='https://mailman.boum.org/listinfo/tails-l10n/'>subscribe</a> to
the list if you want to become a regular translator.

Any message sent to this list is stored in a public archive, so beware
of what your email content and headers reveal about yourself: location,
IP address, etc.

How to work with PO files
=========================

Many different workflows can be used to translate Tails using PO files.
This section describes some options, from the fastest to start working
to the more comfortable to work with in the long run.

Download the PO files directly
------------------------------

For each custom program, you can download the PO files, via gitweb.

  - Tails Greeter:
    [PO files](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=tails/tails-greeter.git;a=tree;f=po;hb=HEAD),
    [README.translators](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=tails/tails-greeter.git;a=blob_plain;f=README.translators;hb=HEAD)
  - Tails Persistence Setup:
    [PO files](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=tails/persistence-setup.git;a=tree;f=po;hb=HEAD)
  - Tails USB Installer:
    [PO files](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=tails/liveusb-creator.git;a=tree;f=po;hb=HEAD)
  - Whisperback:
    [PO files](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=whisperback.git;a=tree;f=po;hb=HEAD),
    [README.translators](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=whisperback.git;a=blob_plain;f=README.translators;hb=HEAD)
  - Some smaller programs written for Tails: [PO files](!tails_devel_gitweb_dir
    config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/locale)
  - [The launchers on the desktop](!tails_devel_gitweb_dir
    config/chroot_local-includes/etc/skel/Desktop), those are not PO
    files, and includes the translations directly

For the website, you can browse the tree of its source code via gitweb
as well. Each page which is translated has separate PO files.

  - [Source code of the
    website](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=tree;f=wiki/src)

Once your translation work is done, you can send it by email to the
[[tails-l10n mailing list|/contribute/how/translate#tails-l10n]].

Using Git
---------

In the long run, many people find it more convenient to get updated
versions of the source code, and its PO files, using
[[Git|contribute/git]].

You can also take advantage of Git to send us you work; either by
sending us Git patches or by asking us to pull from your Git branch.

Note that the website shall be translated in the `master` branch,
while custom Tails programs live in the `devel` branch.

### Send us Git patches

1. Clone Tails [[Git repository|contribute/git]] onto your local system.
2. Translate whatever you can in your preferred PO file editor. 
3. Commit the changes you made to `.po` files.
   You could encounter numerous false positive when committing modified `.po`
   files. It's due to the fact that Poedit [doesn't handle the wordwrapping 
   correctly](http://www.poedit.net/trac/ticket/25). In order to avoid this, 
   you should run the following command :
     `msgcat --width=80 -o your_output_file.po your_input_file.po`
4. Use the `git format-patch` command to prepare patches.
5. Send your patches on the [[tails-l10n mailing list|/contribute/how/translate#tails-l10n]].
6. Frequently merge changes from our main repository into yours.

### Ask us to pull from your Git branch

1. Setup your personal [[Git repository|contribute/git]]: if you already know
   where to host it in a public place, this is great; or else [fork us
   on repo.or.cz](http://repo.or.cz/w/tails.git).
2. Translate whatever you can in your preferred PO file editor. 
3. Commit the changes you made to `.po` files.
   You could encounter numerous false positive when committing modified `.po`
   files. It's due to the fact that Poedit [doesn't handle the wordwrapping 
   correctly](http://www.poedit.net/trac/ticket/25). In order to avoid this, 
   you should run the following command :
     `msgcat --width=80 -o your_output_file.po your_input_file.po`
4. Push your changes to your online Git repository.
5. Ask on the [[tails-l10n mailing list|/contribute/how/translate#tails-l10n]]
   to pull from the branch you worked on.
6. Frequently merge changes from our main repository into yours.

# Add support for a new language

For Tails to be available in a new language, both the website and the custom
programs need to be translated. Please keep in mind that this represents quite a
lot of work.

Therefore, here are a few things that would be required in order to start
translating Tails to a new language:

1. It is really required to be a team of translators and not a single person.
That also allows for peer reviews between the team, more flexibility when
important deadlines arrives, etc.

2. At least part of the team should subscribe to the [[tails-l10n mailing
list|translate#tails-l10n]]

3. Since the content of the website is sensitive in terms of privacy
protection, Tails developers need to establish contacts with trusted people
to review the work from time to time.

4. Keep in mind that useful translations need to be maintained in the long run.
This maybe takes a few hours a month.

Once those conditions are fulfilled, the new team can start working on a first
batch of translations.

  - Some of our custom programs:
    - Tails Greeter
    - Tails Persistence Setup
    - Tails USB Installer
    - Whisperback

  - Important parts of our website:

    - [[/index]]
    - [[/about]] page
    - [[/getting_started]] page
    - [[/support]] page
    - [[/download]] page

    - [[/doc/first_steps]] section

Do not hesitate to report the progress of your work on the [[tails-l10n
mailing list|/contribute/how/translate#tails-l10n]].
