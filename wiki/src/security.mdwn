# Probable holes

Until an [[audit|todo/applications_audit]] of the bundled network
applications is done, information leakages at the protocol level
should be considered as − at the very least − possible.

# Fixed holes

**WARNING**: some of these holes may only be fixed in [[Git]].
Please carefully read the "Affected versions" sections bellow.

## ineffective firewall-level Tor enforcement

The `openntpd` package is not installed anymore since commit
bf8cc787ce46e9946ab47d5383feb1174da3f22a (20091006). The `ntpd` user
is then non-existent on built amnesia systems.

This user is however mentioned in `/etc/firewall.conf`.
`iptables-restore` being apparently picky about imperfect
configuration files, it refuses to load it, and the firewall-level Tor
enforcement is therefore not effective.

### Impact

Some applications establish direct connections through the Internet,
not using the Tor network at all.

Details:

* iceweasel is not affected, thanks to the torbutton extension
* applications that take into account the relevant environment
  variables (namely `http_proxy`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `SOCKS_SERVER` and
  `SOCKS5_SERVER`) are not affected
* any other application, such as Pidgin or Thunderbird, is probably
  affected.

### Solution

This problem has been fixed in [[Git]] commit 9c425e8de13e6b4f885.

### Affected versions

No released amnesia version is affected.

Custom images built from Git snapshots equal of after
bf8cc787ce46e9946ab47d5383feb1174da3f22a (20091006), and before
9c425e8de13e6b4f885 (excluded), are affected.

## use of cleartext swap partitions on local hard disks

At least until its version 1.157.4-1, `live-initramfs` has
a [bug](http://lists.debian.org/debian-live/2009/09/msg00125.html)
that makes it use any cleartext swap partition found on local
hard disks.

### Impact

Any kind of information about the user's activities can be stored on
the local hard disks of the computers being used with affected
amnesia systems.

### Mitigation of passed effects

It is recommended to securely erase, using a program such as `shred`,
any cleartext Linux swap partition present on computers having been
used with affected amnesia systems.

### Solution

We fixed this hole on 20091006 (commit 00c1ff633e8958d0233) by
installing a custom fixed `live-initramfs` package into built images.

The relevant patch was then
[integrated](http://lists.debian.org/debian-live/2009/10/msg00124.html)
in upstream's Git.

### Affected versions

Releases 0.2-20090815 and 0.2-20090816 are affected, as well as any
custom image built from Git before commit 00c1ff633e8958d0233.
