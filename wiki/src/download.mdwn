You can fetch the source code as a [[tarball]] or using [[git]], and
[[build]] your own Live system image.

**NEW**: [pre-built images](https://amnesia.boum.org/torrents/) can be
downloaded using BitTorrent. Any help welcome: don't hesitate
seeding those!

The images downloaded this way are signed with our [[GnuPG key]]; you
can, and should, verify their integrity before using them. Example:

        gpg --verify amnesia-gnome-fr-0.2-20090815.iso.asc amnesia-gnome-fr-0.2-20090815.iso

(FIXME: explain a user-friendly way to do so)
