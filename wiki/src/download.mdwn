Pre-built images
================

Pre-built images can be downloaded using BitTorrent. Here are the
latest available BitTorrent files, signatures and packages lists
([full list](/torrents/files/)):

[[!map pages="torrents/files/*.torrent
or torrents/files/*.asc
or torrents/files/*.packages
or torrents/files/*.sha256
"
show="30"]]

The images downloaded this way are signed with our [[GnuPG key]]; you
can, and should, verify their integrity before using them. Example:

        gpg --verify amnesia-gnome-fr-0.2-20090815.iso.asc amnesia-gnome-fr-0.2-20090815.iso

(FIXME: explain a user-friendly way to do so)

Any help is more than welcome: don't hesitate seeding those!

We also have
a [mailing-list](https://boum.org/mailman/listinfo/amnesia-news), as
well as [RSS](/torrents/rss/index.rss) and
[Atom](/torrents/rss/index.atom) feeds to announce new available
BitTorrent files.

Source code
===========

You can fetch the source code as a [[tarball]] or using [[git]], and
[[build]] your own Live system image.
