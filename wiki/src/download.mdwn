Pre-built images
================

Pre-built images can be downloaded using BitTorrent. The BitTorrent
files, signatures and corresponding packages lists [can be found
here](/torrents/files/).

The images downloaded this way are signed with our [[GnuPG key]]; you
can, and should, verify their integrity before using them. Example:

        gpg --verify amnesia-gnome-fr-0.2-20090815.iso.asc amnesia-gnome-fr-0.2-20090815.iso

(FIXME: explain a user-friendly way to do so)

Any help is more than welcome: don't hesitate seeding those!

We also have [RSS](/torrents/rss/index.rss) and
[Atom](/torrents/rss/index.atom) feeds to announce new available
BitTorrent files.

Source code
===========

You can fetch the source code as a [[tarball]] or using [[git]], and
[[build]] your own Live system image.
