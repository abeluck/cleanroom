After following the steps for "[[contribute/release_process/test/erase_memory_on_shutdown]]"
it turns out some patterns may survive the wipe which indicates that
not all memory was wiped. One theory for this is that the new kernel
loaded by kexec may allocate some buffer, which then is filled with
the pattern and won't get cleared, since sdmem only wipes unallocated
memory.

This was supposedly not a problem for some testers prior to Tails 0.8
but I can reliably reproduce this problem on a machine (with 4 GB or
RAM if that matters) with both Tails 0.8 and 0.7.2.
