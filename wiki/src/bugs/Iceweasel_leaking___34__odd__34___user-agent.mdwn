User-agent reported by current version of Amnesic (ISO
amnesia-i386-0.5-20100501) appears to be non-standard. Iceweasel
config "general.useragent.override" reports user-agent as "Mozilla/5.0
(Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; chrome://global/locale/intl.properties;
rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3". Surely this should be
something generic like "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT
6.1)" or a Firefox equivilent? Should the "chrome://..." be replaced
with something else?

I thought that as the Tor Button was being used, its user-agent would
be used (config extensions.torbutton.useragent_override), but this
doesn't appear to be the case.

You can verify this by visiting ifconfig.me or using config:about.

As a suggestion could the User-Agent-Switcher plugin be used so your
browser profile could be altered during a session, alongside using
TOR's change identify?
