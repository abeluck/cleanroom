Onboard doesn't work at startup in squeeze : when trying to use it in azerty, it passes in qwerty
when the window is clicked.

If one sets the X11 keyboard layout, e.g. using `gnome-keyboard-properties` or `setxkbmap`,
it works.

Florence is affected by exactly the same bug, so it seems that it's a bug outside of the
virtual keyboard, but rather somewhere in X libs.

It appears that `python-virtkey` function `virtkey_get_current_group_name` in `/src/python-virtkey.c`
returns `USA` instead of `France` when the bug appears. The wrong value is obtained from the
 following code (with a lot af more security checks):

    XkbGetState(display, XkbUseCoreKbd, &state
    state.locked_group
    Atom atom = cvirt->kbd->names->groups[group];
    char * group_name = XGetAtomName(display, atom);

> This might have been fixed in the meantime. Let's check if
> `python-virtkey` or the X libs have been updated since the original
> bug report (Nov 1st 2010), re-test this, and maybe report bugs
> upstream. For the record: alternative virtual keyboards are listed
> and compared on [[another todo item|todo/virtual_keyboard_in_Debian]].
