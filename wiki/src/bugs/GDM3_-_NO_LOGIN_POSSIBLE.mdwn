Good day,

I installed on a 2 GB USB stick Tails 0.9. No problem so far, the stick boots, I can choose the language, GDM3 starts up with a login screen. No luck at all to login. On the command tty I am able to login as root with pwd amnesia. What's wrong with the GUI-Login? Thank's for any help in advance.
