#### TAILS 0.8 

After establishing Tor circuit and automatically starting Iceweasel warning appears in Vidalia Message Log:

* *Basic* <br />
[05:54:14] Potentially Dangerous Connection! - One of your applications established a connection through Tor to "8.8.8.8:53" using a protocol that may leak information about your destination. Please ensure you configure your applications to use only SOCKS4a or SOCKS5 with remote hostname resolution.

* *Advanced* <br />
Sep 26 05:54:14.291 [Warning] Your application (using socks4 to port 53) is giving Tor only an IP address. Applications that do DNS resolves themselves may leak information. Consider using Socks4A (e.g. via privoxy or socat) instead. For more information, please see https://wiki.torproject.org/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#SOCKSAndDNS.
