#### TAILS 0.8 

After establishing Tor circuit and automatically starting Iceweasel warning appears in Vidalia Message Log:

* *Basic* <br />
[05:54:14] Potentially Dangerous Connection! - One of your applications established a connection through Tor to "8.8.8.8:53" using a protocol that may leak information about your destination. Please ensure you configure your applications to use only SOCKS4a or SOCKS5 with remote hostname resolution.

* *Advanced* <br />
Sep 26 05:54:14.291 [Warning] Your application (using socks4 to port 53) is giving Tor only an IP address. Applications that do DNS resolves themselves may leak information. Consider using Socks4A (e.g. via privoxy or socat) instead. For more information, please see https://wiki.torproject.org/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#SOCKSAndDNS.

EDIT: Sometimes Iceweasel starts automatically with the system, sometimes not but the warning appears irrespective of it.

EDIT#2: OPs were not specific, but for me, on 2 different hardware clients (HP tower & Dell LT), using different circuits, from different ISPs, in Tails 0.8 Tor failed to load (circuit node search timed out) after announcing this error in the Vidalia message log. Tails 0.72 had been running perfectly on the HP. YMMV but for some of us it appears that unedited v0.8 is completely broken...
