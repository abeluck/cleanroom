FireGPG does not support `hkps://`.

- If `extensions.firegpg.keyserver` is set to `keys.indymedia.org`,
  which is currently the case in T(A)ILS, FireGPG invokes gpg with the
  `--keyserver keys.indymedia.org` option that prevents the use of
  `hkps://`
- If `extensions.firegpg.keyserver` is not set, the default FireGPG
  keyserver (`pool.sks-keyservers.net`) is used.
- If `extensions.firegpg.keyserver` is set to
  `hkps://keys.indymedia.org`, it does not pass FireGPG preferences
  validation and the default FireGPG keyserver is used.
- If `extensions.firegpg.keyserver` is set to an empty string, the
  default FireGPG keyserver is used.

We now should patch FireGPG to validate this setting in a less
restrictive way.
