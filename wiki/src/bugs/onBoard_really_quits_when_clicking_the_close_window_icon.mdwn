In T(A)ILS 0.5 (?), clicking the "Close window" cross on the right
of its window's top bar would hide onBoard into the notification area,
keeping it one-click-away from being used again.

The same operation now quits onBoard for real and one has to dig into
the programs menu in order to launch it again.
