Hello,

a Tails user just reported it on IRC and I report it here as I had the same thought too for a while.

Possibly it's better to mute the audio or set the volume to zero at boot time because system sounds and accidentially run audio/video files could raise suspicion.

Maybe it's better to let the user do the 2 clicks to enable it, just to be on the safe side.
