Tails 0.8

Tails seems to be resetting the clock to 16 September 2011 12:00am at start up, subsequently causing Vidalia/Tor to fail at boot time. Booting back to the Ubuntu installation on the internal hard drive consistently shows the correct date and time.  

Is it possible that the bug fix (link below) is what is resetting the system time? If so how can I further analyse this issue?
