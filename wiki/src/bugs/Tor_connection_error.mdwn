Booting into Tails 0.9 and connection to the Tor network never happens.  Vidalia message is "Loading authority certificates" and it never progresses from there.  Showing the Tor network shows no systems at all.  No problem connecting with the previous Tails version on the same system, network, etc.

> Does it happen consistently, or was it just once?
