I can't get any sound with Tails 0.10.1 on my laptop. It's too low to hear. Had the same problem on my friend's laptop.

Didn't have this issue before 0.10.1 so is it about the linux kernel? (sounds working on Windows 7)

>>> It was same on 0.10.2, then I entered Volume Control. The speaker volume setting was at lowest. Why did you change that, why don't you simply mute the master volume?
