When trying to create persistens volume.
It starts and after some time (about a minute) error comes.

Persistence wizard - Persistence volume creation

Failed

After that flash becomes unbootable.


On a 2Gb flash drive it's ok. Works fine.
Tried different USB ports, stays the same.

Sorry, if it's know issue. Didn't find it.
