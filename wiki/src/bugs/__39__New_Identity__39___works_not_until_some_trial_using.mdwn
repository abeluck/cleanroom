Click 'New Identity' in Vidalia-Icon(toptasbar&in Browser.).Multiple.I get now new IP(check.torproject.org).
After more or less 10 minutes(normal circuit change ?) the 'New Identity'-function in Vidalia-Icon seems working(a new IP
according to check.torproject.org).
Is this function dependent on about:config(delete URL-entries&JAVA-filelocation-entries)-seems not.
