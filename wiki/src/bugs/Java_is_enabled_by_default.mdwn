Java is enabled by default in the browser. That radio button should be unmarked. 

Anonymous mentioned in the irc chat that the tor button should disable java and the browser setting should not matter if the tor button works correct. 

Tested with 0.7.1 and a virtualbox in ubuntu 10.10, no changes made and then i browsed to this page

Got this confirmation message (along with screensize etc)
"JavaScript is enabled and working"

>> Javascript, im sorry for the confusion. The problem is that some pages, like the test page i

Turned off the java setting in the browser and the java page did not load as before and told me java was OFF. 

For new users that does not test these things before they use tails, this could be a problem, hopefully a solution can be found before next release.
