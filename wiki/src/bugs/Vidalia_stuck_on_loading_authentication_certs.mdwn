Tried with 3 different comp configs - 2 on actual hardware and 1 inside a VM - and same lockup on the Vidalia software with each. I also got the same messages in Tor log as previous poster regarding ' connection to 8.8.8.8:53 '. Without internet connection (through Tor) , or being able to stop and restart Vidalia to see if it clears up lockup, the image is worthless. Getting connected to wireless or wired network is fine, just that the features of the image arent working to get internet.
