When the network cable is unplugged at boot time, and plugged after
the Gnome session is started, no Tor circuit is built.
Restarting the Tor service is then needed.

Either the SIGHUP way now used to tell Tor to reconfigure itself is
insufficient, or NetworkManager does not invoke
`/etc/network/if-up.d/600tor` at all.
