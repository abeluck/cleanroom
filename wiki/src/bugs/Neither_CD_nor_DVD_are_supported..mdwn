Steps for reproducing error:

1-I downloaded the ISO file.
2-Signature verified successfully.
3-I went to create a "DVD".

ERROR: If I put a blank DVD, either RW or ROM, the message is that NO RECOGNIZES AS DVD 0.

If I put a blank CD, RW or Rom, claims for 753 MB free space, and refuse to burn.

IS THIS AN DVD IMAGE??? OR A CD IMAGE??

IS FOR A RW OR ROM media????

I fight with this but I cannot solve the problem.

GREETINGS FROM ARGENTINA. Excuse me for my english.
