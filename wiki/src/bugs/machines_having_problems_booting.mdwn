Some machines seems to have problems booting a USB created by Tails USB
Installer.

This list might not be accurate nor complete.

# Dell Inc. Latitude E6430/0CPWYR, BIOS A03 06/03/2012

    Invalid partition table!

# Dell System XPS L702X/03RG89, BIOS A17 02/22/2012

Some users reported that the BIOS shipped by Dell doesn't know how to
deal with the GPT partition scheme installed by Tails on the USB.
