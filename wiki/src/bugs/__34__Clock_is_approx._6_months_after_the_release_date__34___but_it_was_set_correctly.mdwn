Here's a patch for /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/50-htp.sh

    39d38
    < 	mail.riseup.net
    177c176
    < 	if [ "$(($release_date_secs + 259200))" -lt "$current_date_secs" ]; then
    ---
    > 	if [ "$(($release_date_secs + 15552000))" -lt "$current_date_secs" ]; then

For the last two days, mail.riseup.net is frequently failing, triggering htpdate's paranoid mode. Thus /usr/local/sbin/htpdate returns an error to 50-htp.sh, which checks is_clock_way_off and finds the clock is more than 3 days (rather than the intended 180 days) later than Tails 0.8 release date. 

So, Tails boots up with the hardware clock set correctly, sets the software clock back to September 16, and then can't connect to Tor.

Output at /var/log/htpdate.log looks something like this:

    Running htpdate.

    Clock is approx. 6 months after the release date
    Running htpdate.

    Paranoid mode: aborting as one server ( https://mail.riseup.net ) could not be reached

If you're going to use paranoid mode, then you should stick to the most reliable servers. Apparently mail.riseup.net cannot always handle the traffic.
