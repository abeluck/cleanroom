Can someone on the TAILS project team please clarify the approved method for clearing reported bugs from this list? There were several recent bugs reported between 2011-Sep-26 and 2011-Sep-28 concerning the failure of Tails v0.8 to establish a Tor connection, and the error messages that accompanied that issue. Today, those reports are nowehere to be found: not on this list; the "pending" list; or the "to do" list. Even if a bug has been analyzed and found to be erroneous, I would expect it to remain on the reported list for a period of time along with an explanation of why it was found to be invalid (or to move to a list specifically for that disposition). Frankly, for an FOSS project, this apparent lack of transparency is discouraging.
