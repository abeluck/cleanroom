The stick (GMD3) does also not work on other PC's. I verified the iso before installing. I installed from Debian 6.0.3. The stick is ext4 formatted and marked as bootable. Therefore it boots :) I followed the instructions for installing the iso under linux. cat [tails.iso] > [destination] && sync. Where is the difference formatting the stick as fat32? I usually prefer ext3 or ext4. Thank you for your reply. stefan.
