When I right-click on the Network icon in the upper right-hand-side of the main menu bar at the top of my display (re: tails-0.7.2-i386.iso release) and disable the Enable Networking checked box, and then subsequently right-click and recheck the box - there is not confirmation that Networking has been re-enabled while my router is live.

The rechecking of the Enable Networking should reestablish a connection (via auto eth0) and a message to that effect should pop up.

This might be a problem with the baseline Debian Squeeze release used to build the TAILS 0.7.2 bug fix release.  The problem was also in release 0.7.1, but I forgot to report it.
