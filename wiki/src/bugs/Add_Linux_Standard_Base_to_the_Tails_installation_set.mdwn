Please ship Tails with the Linux Standard Base (lsb) so that certain printer drivers can be installed.

> In Tails 0.11, dpkg states that lsb is not installed which leads to installation failure.

Otherwise, there is no chance to get those printer drivers started.

> Perhaps you should be more specific about what printer?
> In may experience, Tails supports out-of-the-box most printers I've thrown at it.

> Tails does not support certain all-in-one printers out-of-the-box. But this is not the problem because the required driver could be added manually if the lsb package were included in Tails.
