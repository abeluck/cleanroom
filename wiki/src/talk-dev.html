      you can [subscribe](https://boum.org/mailman/listinfo/tails-dev/) or write
      to the <tails-dev@boum.org> mailing-list; any message sent to this
      list is stored in a public archive, so beware of what your email content

  For matters that need to be hidden from the public eyes, you can send email to
	the private development mailing list: <amnesia@boum.org>; encrypting such
	email with our [[GnuPG key]] is the only way to achieve end-to-end encryption.
