	<h1>3. Verify the ISO image</h1>

	<p>It is important to check the [[!wikipedia Data_integrity

	trust the content of this website. But, [[as explained on our warning
	page|doc/warning#index3h1]], you could still be victim of a
	man-in-the-middle attack while using HTTPS. On this website as much as
	on any other of the Internet.</p>

	<p>It is anyway a good thing to check the ISO image integrity first. We
	will propose you after that some more advanced techniques to <a
	href="#authenticity-check">check the authenticity of the ISO
	image</a>.</p>

	<p>All Tails ISO image are cryptographically signed by our OpenPGP key.
	OpenPGP is a standard for data encryption that provides cryptographic
	privacy and authentication through the use of keys owned by its users.
	Checking this signature is the recommended way of checking the ISO image

sudo apt-get install seahorse-plugins
</pre>

	<p>First, download [[!tails_website tails.key desc="Tails' key"]].</p>

	<p>Your browser should propose you to open it with "Import Key". Choose

	Ubuntu, Tails and many other distributions.</p>

	<p>First, download [[!tails_website tails.key desc="Tails' key"]].</p>

	<p>Open a terminal and import Tails' key with the following
	commands:</p>

<pre>
cd [the directory in which you downloaded the key]
cat tails.key | gpg --impot

gpg: Total number processed: 2
gpg:               imported: 2  (RSA: 2)
</pre>

	<p>If you had already imported Tails' key in the past, the output should

	<h2><a name="verify-the-iso-with-others"></a>Using other operating

	<h3>Using Firefox</h3>

	<p>This technique is not using the cryptographic signature as the others
	do. We propose it because it's especially easy for Windows users.</p>

	<p>Install the CheckIt extension for Firefox available <a
	href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/checkit/">here</a>
	and restart Firefox.</p>

	<p>Here is the checksum (a kind of digital fingerprint) of the ISO

	<pre>[[!inline pages="inc/stable_i386_hash" raw="yes"]]</pre>

	<p>Right-click on it and choose "Selected hash (SHA256)" from the
	contextual menu:</p>

	<p><img src="download/selected_hash.png"/></p>

	<p>From the dialog box that shows up, open the ISO image. Then wait for
	the checksum to compute. This will take several seconds during which
	your browser will be unresponsive.</p>

	<p><strong>If the ISO image is correct</strong> you will get a

	<p><img src="download/checksums_match.png"/></p>

	<p><strong>If the ISO image is not correct</strong> you will get a

	<p><img src="download/checksums_do_not_match.png"/></p>

	<h3>Using the cryptographic signature</h3>

	<p>GnuPG, a common free software implementation of OpenPGP has versions
	and graphical frontends for both Windows and Mac OS X. This also make it
	possible to check the cryptographic signature with those operating
	systems:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>[[Gpg4win|http://www.gpg4win.org/]], for Windows</li>
	  <li>[[GPGTools|http://www.gpgtools.org/]], for Mac OS X</li>
	</ul>

	<p>You will find on either of those websites detailed documentation on
	how to install and use them.</p>

	<h3>For Windows using Gpg4win</h3>

	<p>After installing Gpg4win, download [[!tails_website tails.key
	desc="Tails' key"]].</p>

	<p>[[Consult the Gpg4win documentation to import
	it|http://www.gpg4win.org/doc/en/gpg4win-compendium_15.html]]</p>

	<p>Then, download the cryptographic signature corresponding to the ISO
	image you want to verify:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li><a href=[[!inline pages="inc/stable_i386_sig_url" raw="yes"]]>
	  [[!inline pages="inc/stable_i386_sig_filename" raw="yes"]]</a></li>
	</ul>

	<p>[[Consult the Gpg4win documentation to check the
	signature|http://www.gpg4win.org/doc/en/gpg4win-compendium_24.html#id4]]</p>

	<h3>For Mac OS X using GPGTools</h3>

	<p>After installing GPGTools, you should be able to follow the
	instruction <a href="#verify-the-iso-with-terminal">using Linux with the
	command line</a>. To open the command line, navigate to your
	Applications folder, open Utilities, and double click on Terminal.</p>

	</div>

	<h2><a name="authenticity-check"></a>So how can I check better the ISO
	image authenticity?</h2>

	<p>But the Tails' key that you downloaded from this website could be a
	fake one if you were victim of a [[man-in-the-middle
	attack|doc/warning#index3h1]].

	<p>Finding a way of trusting better Tails' key would allow you to
	authenticate better the ISO image you downloaded. The following section
	will give you hints on how to increase the trust you can put in the
	Tails' key you downloaded.</p>

	<p>We will present you three techniques from the easiest to the safest.
	Again, none of them is a perfect and magic solution. Feel free to
	explore them according to your possibilities and technical skills.</p>

	<p>Note that since all Tails' releases are signed with the same key,
	you will not have to verify the key every time and the trust you might
	progressively build in it will be built once and for all. Still, you
	will have to check the ISO image every time you download a new one!</p>

	<h3>Correlates several download of Tails' key</h3>

	<p>A simple technique to increase the trust you can put in Tails' key
	would be to download it several times, from several locations, several
	computers, possibly several countries, etc.</p>

	<p>For example you could save them every time with a different name in
	the same directory on a USB stick. Then run the following command from
	a terminal to check whether all the keys are identical:</p>

<pre>
cd [your download directory]
sha256sum amnesia*.asc
</pre>

	<p>This command would output something like this:</p>

<pre>
f11c8e27f86e173bc14be342d7d97042d5e4ee6fa0ddfd55b2ec3fabe4e55e43  amnesia-desktop.asc
f11c8e27f86e173bc14be342d7d97042d5e4ee6fa0ddfd55b2ec3fabe4e55e43  amnesia-laptop.asc
f11c8e27f86e173bc14be342d7d97042d5e4ee6fa0ddfd55b2ec3fabe4e55e43  amnesia-library.asc
f11c8e27f86e173bc14be342d7d97042d5e4ee6fa0ddfd55b2ec3fabe4e55e43  amnesia-seattle.asc
</pre>

	<p>You would then need to visually check that all the checksums of the
	first column are the same, meaning that the keys are identical.</p>

	<p>You could also use this technique to compare keys downloaded by your
	friends or other people you trust.</p>

	<h3>Using the OpenPGP Web of Trust</h3>

	<p>If you want to be extra cautious and really authenticate Tails' key
	in a stronger way than what standard HTTPS offers you, you will need to
	use the OpenPGP Web of Trust.</p>

	<p>One of the inherent problems of standard HTTPS is that the trust we
	usually put on a website is defined by certificate authorities: a
	hierarchical and closed set of companies and governmental institutions
	approved by web browser vendors. This model of trust has long been
	criticized and proved several times to be vulnerable to attacks [[as
	explained on our warning page|doc/warning#index3h1]].</p>

	<p>We believe instead that users should be given the final say when
	trusting a website, and that designation of trust should be done on the
	basis of human interaction.</p>

	<p>The OpenPGP [[!wikipedia Web_of_Trust desc="Web of Trust"]] is a
	decentralized trust model based on OpenPGP keys. Let's see that with an
	example.</p>

	<p><em>You're a friend of Alice and really trust her way of managing
	OpenPGP keys. You're trusting Alice's key.</em></p>

	<p><em>Furthermore, Alice met Bob, a Tails developer, in a conference,
	and signed Bob's key. Alice is trusting Bob's key.</em></p>

	<p><em>Bob is a Tails developer who directly owns the Tails' key. Bob
	fully trusts Tails' key.</em></p>

	<p>This scenario creates a trust path from you to Tails' key that could
	allow you to trust Tails' key without having to depend on certificate
	authorities.</p>

	<p>This trust model is not perfect either and requires both caution and
	intelligent supervision by users. The technical details of creating,
	managing and trusting OpenPGP keys is outside of the scope of this
	document.</p>

	<p>We also acknowledge that not everybody might be able to create good
	trust path to Tails' key since it based on a network of direct human
	relationships and the knowledge of quite complex tools such as
	OpenPGP.</p>

	<h3>Check Tails' key against the Debian keyring</h3>

	<p>Following the previous scenario, when Alice met Bob, a Tails
	developer, she could sign Tails' key with her own key to certify this
	trust relationship and make it public. Tails' key would now come along
	with a signature made by Alice.</p>

	<p>Tails' key is actually already signed by the keys of several
	official developers of Debian, the operating system on which Tails is
	based. Debian makes an extensive use of OpenPGP and you can download
	the keys of all Debian developers by installing the
	<code>debian-keyring</code> package. You can then verify the signatures
	those developers made with their own key on Tails' key.</p>

	<p>To download the Debian keyring you can do:</p>

	<pre>sudo apt-get install debian-keyring</pre>

	<p>To get a list of the signatures made by other people on Tails' key
	you can do:</p>

	<pre>gpg --keyid-format long --list-sigs 1202821CBE2CD9C1</pre>

	<p>You will get something like this:</p>

<pre>
pub   4096R/1202821CBE2CD9C1 2010-10-07 [expires: 2012-10-06]

sig          CCD2ED94D21739E9 2010-12-29  [User ID not found]
</pre>

	<p>The lines ending with '[User ID not found]' are signatures made by
	keys you still don't have in your keyring. You could try to search for
	them in the Debian keyring by their key ID: the 16 digit code between
	the 'sig' tag and the date. You could for example do:</p>

	<pre>gpg --keyid-format long --keyring=/usr/share/keyrings/debian-keyring.gpg --list-key CCD2ED94D21739E9</pre>

	<p>If this signature corresponds to a key in the Debian keyring you
	will get something like this:</p>

<pre>
pub   4096R/CCD2ED94D21739E9 2007-06-02 [expires: 2012-05-31]

sub   2048R/125868EA4BFA08E4 2008-06-19 [expires: 2011-05-31]
</pre>

	<p>You can then import it in your own keyring by doing:</p>

	<pre>gpg --keyring=/usr/share/keyrings/debian-keyring.gpg --export CCD2ED94D21739E9 | gpg --import</pre>

	<p>Now you can try to verify the signature made by this new key on Tails' key by doing:</p>

	<pre>gpg --keyid-format long --check-sigs 1202821CBE2CD9C1</pre>

	<p>On the output, The status of the verification is indicated by a flag
	directly following the "sig" tag. A "!" indicates that the signature
	has been successfully verified, a  "-" denotes a bad signature and a
	"%" is used if an error occurred while checking the signature (e.g. a
	non supported algorithm). For example, in the following output the
	signature of Daniel Kahn Gillmor on Tails' key has been successfully
	verified:</p>

<pre>

	<h3>Get into the Web of Trust!</h3>

	<p>Since the Web of Trust is actually based on human relationships and

	with people knowledgeable about OpenPGP, start using it yourself and
	build trust relationships in order to find your own trust path to

	<p>Refer to our [[security announcements|/security]] feed for more
	detailed information about the security holes affecting Tails.
	Furthermore you will be automatically notified of the security holes
	affecting the version you are using at the startup of a new Tails
	session.</p>

	<p>Since Tails is based on Debian, it takes advantages of the all of the
	work done by the Debian security team. As quoted from <a
	href="http://security.debian.org/">(http://security.debian.org/)</a>:</p>

	<blockquote>Debian takes security very seriously. We handle all
	security problems brought to our attention and ensure that they are
	corrected within a reasonable timeframe. Many advisories are coordinated
	with other free software vendors and are published the same day a
	vulnerability is made public and we also have a Security Audit team that
	reviews the archive looking for new or unfixed security bugs.
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>Experience has shown that "security through obscurity" does
	not work. Public disclosure allows for more rapid and better solutions
	to security problems. In that vein, this page addresses Debian's status
	with respect to various known security holes, which could potentially
	affect Debian.</blockquote>

	<h1>6. Starting Tails!</h1>

	<p>Now that you have a Tails CD or USB stick you can shutdown your
	computer and start using Tails without altering your existing operating
	system.</p>

	<p><strong>If you're using a CD:</strong> Put the Tails CD into the
	CD/DVD-drive and restart the computer. You should see a welcome screen
	prompting you to choose your language.</p>

	<p>If you don't get this menu, you can consult the Ubuntu documentation
	about <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootFromCD">booting
	from the CD</a> for more information, especially the part on the <a
	href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootFromCD#BIOS%20is%20not%20set%20to%20boot%20from%20CD%20or%20DVD%20drive">
	BIOS settings</a>.</p>

	<p><strong>If you're using a USB stick:</strong> Shutdown the computer,
	plug in your USB stick and start the computer. You should see a welcome
	screen prompting you to choose your language.</p>

	<p>If your computer does not automatically do so, you might need to edit
	the BIOS settings. Restart your computer, and watch for a message
	telling you which key to press to enter the BIOS setup. It will usually
	be one of F1, F2, DEL, ESC or F10. Press this key while your computer is
	booting to edit your BIOS settings. You need to edit the Boot Order.
	Depending on your computer you should see an entry for 'removable drive'
	or 'USB media'. Move this to the top of the list to force the computer
	to attempt to boot from USB before booting from the hard disk. Save your
	changes and continue.</p>
