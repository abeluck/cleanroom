	<h1>3. Verify the ISO image</h1>

	<p>It is important to check the [[!wikipedia Data_integrity

	<p>It is anyway a good thing to check the ISO image integrity first. We

<p>The released images are signed with our [[GnuPG key]]; you
can, and should, verify their integrity before using them.</p>

<p>Users of a recent enough GNOME should make sure they have the
<code>seahorse-plugins</code> package installed, then right-click on
the <code>.asc</code> OpenPGP signature file, and open it with the
<emph>Verify signature</emph> tool.</p>

<!-- TODO: explain where the .asc file can be found, i.e. in
     torrents/files/ ; master branch probably still has an inline
     directive to find it -->

<p>Others rather need to do this on the command-line, in the directory
where the <code>.iso</code> and <code>.asc</code> files are:</p>

<pre>
gpg --verify tails*.iso.asc
</pre>
	</div>

	<h2><a name="authenticity-check"></a>So how can I check better the ISO
	image authenticity?</h2>

	<p>All Tails ISO image are cryptographically signed by our OpenPGP key.
	OpenPGP is a standard for data encryption and decryption that provides
	cryptographic privacy and authentication through the use of keys owned
	by its users.</p>

	<p>But the Tails' key that you downloaded from this website could be a
	fake one if you were victim of a [[man-in-the-middle
	attack|doc/warning#index3h1]].

	<p>Finding a way of trusting better Tails' key would allow you to
	authenticate better the ISO image you downloaded. The following section
	will give you hints on how to increase the trust you can put in the
	Tails' key you downloaded.</p>

	<p>We will present you three techniques from the easiest to the safest.
	Again, none of them is a perfect and magic solution. Feel free to
	explore them according to your possibilities and technical skills.</p>

	<p>Note that since all Tails' releases are signed with the same key,
	you will not have to verify the key every time and the trust you might
	progressively build in it will be built once and for all. Still, you
	will have to check the ISO image every time you download a new one!</p>

	<h3>Correlates several download of Tails' key</h3>

	<p>A simple technique to increase the trust you can put in Tails' key
	would be to download it several times, from several locations, several
	computers, possibly several countries, etc.</p>

	<p>For example you could save them every time with a different name in
	the same directory on a USB stick. Then run the following command from
	a terminal to check whether all the keys are identical:</p>

<pre>
cd [your download directory]
sha256sum amnesia*.asc
</pre>

	<p>This command would output something like this:</p>

<pre>
f11c8e27f86e173bc14be342d7d97042d5e4ee6fa0ddfd55b2ec3fabe4e55e43  amnesia-desktop.asc
f11c8e27f86e173bc14be342d7d97042d5e4ee6fa0ddfd55b2ec3fabe4e55e43  amnesia-laptop.asc
f11c8e27f86e173bc14be342d7d97042d5e4ee6fa0ddfd55b2ec3fabe4e55e43  amnesia-library.asc
f11c8e27f86e173bc14be342d7d97042d5e4ee6fa0ddfd55b2ec3fabe4e55e43  amnesia-seattle.asc
</pre>

	<p>You would then need to visually check that all the checksums of the
	first column are the same, meaning that the keys are identical.</p>

	<p>You could also use this technique to compare keys downloaded by your
	friends or other people you trust.</p>

	<h3>Using the OpenPGP Web of Trust</h3>

	<p>If you want to be extra cautious and really authenticate Tails' key
	in a stronger way than what standard HTTPS offers you, you will need to
	use the OpenPGP Web of Trust.</p>

	<p>One of the inherent problems of standard HTTPS is that the trust we
	usually put on a website is defined by certificate authorities: a
	hierarchical and closed set of companies and governmental institutions
	approved by web browser vendors. This model of trust has long been
	criticized and proved several times to be vulnerable to attacks [[as
	explained on our warning page|doc/warning#index3h1]].</p>

	<p>We believe instead that users should be given the final say when
	trusting a website, and that designation of trust should be done on the
	basis of human interaction.</p>

	<p>The OpenPGP [[!wikipedia Web_of_Trust desc="Web of Trust"]] is a
	decentralized trust model based on OpenPGP keys. Let's see that with an
	example.</p>

	<p><em>You're a friend of Alice and really trust her way of managing
	OpenPGP keys. You're trusting Alice's key.</em></p>

	<p><em>Furthermore, Alice met Bob, a Tails developer, in a conference,
	and signed Bob's key. Alice is trusting Bob's key.</em></p>

	<p><em>Bob is a Tails developer who directly owns the Tails' key. Bob
	fully trusts Tails' key.</em></p>

	<p>This scenario creates a trust path from you to Tails' key that could
	allow you to trust Tails' key without having to depend on certificate
	authorities.</p>

	<p>This trust model is not perfect either and requires both caution and
	intelligent supervision by users. The technical details of creating,
	managing and trusting OpenPGP keys is outside of the scope of this
	document.</p>

	<p>We also acknowledge that not everybody might be able to create good
	trust path to Tails' key since it based on a network of direct human
	relationships and the knowledge of quite complex tools such as
	OpenPGP.</p>

	<h3>Check Tails' key against the Debian keyring</h3>

	<p>Following the previous scenario, when Alice met Bob, a Tails
	developer, she could sign Tails' key with her own key to certify this
	trust relationship and make it public. Tails' key would now come along
	with a signature made by Alice.</p>

	<p>Tails' key is actually already signed by the keys of several
	official developers of Debian, the operating system on which Tails is
	based. Debian makes an extensive use of OpenPGP and you can download
	the keys of all Debian developers by installing the
	<code>debian-keyring</code> package. You can then verify the signatures
	those developers made with their own key on Tails' key.</p>

	<p>To download the Debian keyring you can do:</p>

	<pre>sudo apt-get install debian-keyring</pre>

	<p>To get a list of the signatures made by other people on Tails' key
	you can do:</p>

	<pre>gpg --keyid-format long --list-sigs 1202821CBE2CD9C1</pre>

	<p>You will get something like this:</p>

<pre>
pub   4096R/1202821CBE2CD9C1 2010-10-07 [expires: 2012-10-06]
uid                          T(A)ILS developers (signing key) <amnesia@boum.org>

sig          CCD2ED94D21739E9 2010-12-29  [User ID not found]
</pre>

	<p>The lines ending with '[User ID not found]' are signatures made by
	keys you still don't have in your keyring. You could try to search for
	them in the Debian keyring by their key ID: the 16 digit code between
	the 'sig' tag and the date. You could for example do:</p>

	<pre>gpg --keyid-format long --keyring=/usr/share/keyrings/debian-keyring.gpg --list-key CCD2ED94D21739E9</pre>

	<p>If this signature corresponds to a key in the Debian keyring you
	will get something like this:</p>

<pre>
pub   4096R/CCD2ED94D21739E9 2007-06-02 [expires: 2012-05-31]
uid                          Daniel Kahn Gillmor <dkg@fifthhorseman.net>
uid                          Daniel Kahn Gillmor <dkg@openflows.com>
uid                          [jpeg image of size 3515]
uid                          Daniel Kahn Gillmor <dkg@debian.org>
sub   4096R/C61BD3EC21484CFF 2007-06-02 [expires: 2012-05-31]
sub   2048R/125868EA4BFA08E4 2008-06-19 [expires: 2011-05-31]
</pre>

	<p>You can then import it in your own keyring by doing:</p>

	<pre>gpg --keyring=/usr/share/keyrings/debian-keyring.gpg --export CCD2ED94D21739E9 | gpg --import</pre>

	<p>Now you can try to verify the signature made by this new key on Tails' key by doing:</p>

	<pre>gpg --keyid-format long --check-sigs 1202821CBE2CD9C1</pre>

	<p>On the output, The status of the verification is indicated by a flag
	directly following the "sig" tag. A "!" indicates that the signature
	has been successfully verified, a  "-" denotes a bad signature and a
	"%" is used if an error occurred while checking the signature (e.g. a
	non supported algorithm). For example, in the following output the
	signature of Daniel Kahn Gillmor on Tails' key has been successfully
	verified:</p>

<pre>
pub   4096R/1202821CBE2CD9C1 2010-10-07 [expires: 2012-10-06]
uid                          T(A)ILS developers (signing key) <amnesia@boum.org>

sig!         CCD2ED94D21739E9 2010-12-29  Daniel Kahn Gillmor <dkg@fifthhorseman.net>

	<h3>Get into the Web of Trust!</h3>

	<p>Since the Web of Trust is actually based on human relationships and
	real-life interactions the best would be to start establishing contacts
	with people knowledgeable about OpenPGP, start using it yourself and
	build trust relationships in order to find your own trust path to
	Tails' key.</p>

	<p>You could start by contacting a local [[!wikipedia Linux_User_Group
