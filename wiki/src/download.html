	<h1>2. Verify the downloaded image integrity</h1>

	<p>It is important to check the integrity of the ISO image you
	downloaded to make sure that it is genuine and that the download went
	well.</p>

	<h2>Using the command line (Linux and Mac)</h2>

	<p>Download the file <a
	href="http://dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails/stable/tails-i386-0.7/tails-i386-0.7.iso.sha256">tails-i386-0.7.iso.sha256</a>
	containing the SHA256 hash in the same directory as the ISO image you
	downloaded.</p>

	<p>Open a terminal and go to the directory of as the ISO image:</p>

	<pre>cd [your iso image directory]</pre>

	<p>Then run the following command to check the integrity of the ISO
	image against the .sha256 file:</p>

	<pre>sha256sum -c tails-i386-0.7.iso.sha256</pre>

	<p>If your ISO image is correct you will get:</p>

	<pre>tails-i386-0.7.iso: OK</pre>

	<h2>Using Firefox (all operating system)</h2>

	<p>Install the CheckIt extension for Firefox available <a
	href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/checkit/">here</a>
	and restart Firefox.</p>

	<p>Select with your cursor the following hash:</p>

	<pre>fd95926c203fc5bff619573c4c040056cdd9b692ecca11e34b4b7bbec5fffe06</pre>

	<p>Right-click on it and choose "Selected hash (256)" from the
	contextual menu:</p>

	<p><img src="download/checkit-selected-hash.png" /></p>

	<p>From the dialog box that shows up, open the ISO image:</p>

	<p><img src="download/checkit-select-a-file.png" /></p>

	<p>Wait for the hash to compute. This should take several seconds during
	which your browser will be unresponsive.</p>

	<p>If the ISO is correct you should a message should appear saying
	"SHA256 checksums match!":</p>

	<p><img src="download/checkit-checksums-match.png" /></p>

	<h2>Using our OpenPGP key</h2>

<p>The released images are signed with our [[GnuPG key]]; you
can, and should, verify their integrity before using them.</p>

<p>Users of a recent enough GNOME should make sure they have the
<code>seahorse-plugins</code> package installed, then right-click on
the <code>.asc</code> OpenPGP signature file, and open it with the
<emph>Verify signature</emph> tool.</p>

<p>Others rather need to do this on the command-line, in the directory
where the <code>.iso</code> and <code>.asc</code> files are:

<pre>
gpg --verify tails*.iso.asc
</pre>
</p>

	<h2>FIXME: What to do if the image is bad?</h2>

</div> <!-- #verify -->

<div id="support">

	<h1>3. Burn your CD or create a USB drive</h1>

	<p>
	Every ISO image we ship is a hybrid one:
	<ul>
	  <li>it can be burnt to a CD;</li>
	  <li>it also contains a full disk image (including partition table) and can
	  thus be [[installed onto a USB stick|support/Installing onto a USB stick]];
	  the USB stick's content is lost in the operation.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p><strong>FIXME:</strong> mention Intel-based Mac users
	sometimes need to upgrade their firmware to get the keyboard
	working in the syslinux boot menu.</p>

	<p>
	<strong>It's very important to keep your Tails version up-to-date, otherwise
	your system will be vulnerable to numerous security holes.</strong> The
	development team is doing its best to release new versions fixing known
	security holes on a regular basis.
	</p>

	<p>New versions are announced on:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>our <a href='https://boum.org/mailman/listinfo/amnesia-news'>news
	mailing-list</a></li>
	<li>our <a href='torrents/rss/index.rss'>RSS</a> and <a
	href='/torrents/rss/index.atom'>Atom</a> feeds that announces new
	available BitTorrent files.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Refer to our [[security announcements|/security]] feed for more
	detailed information about the security holes affecting Tails.
	Furthermore you will be automatically noticed of the security holes
	affecting the version you are using at the startup of a new Tails
	session.</p>

	<p>Since Tails is based on Debian, it takes advantages of the all of the
	work done by the [Debian security team]. As quoted from <a
	href="http://security.debian.org/">(http://security.debian.org/)</a>:</p>

	<blockquote>Debian takes security very seriously. We handle all
	security problems brought to our attention and ensure that they are
	corrected within a reasonable timeframe. Many advisories are coordinated
	with other free software vendors and are published the same day a
	vulnerability is made public and we also have a Security Audit team that
	reviews the archive looking for new or unfixed security bugs.
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>Experience has shown that "security through obscurity" does
	not work. Public disclosure allows for more rapid and better solutions
	to security problems. In that vein, this page addresses Debian's status
	with respect to various known security holes, which could potentially
	affect Debian.</blockquote>
