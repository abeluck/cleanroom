	<h1>3. Verify the ISO image</h1>

	<p>It is important to check the [[!wikipedia Data_integrity

	download went well.</p>

	<p><strong>Warning: the following techniques don't provide you with a
	strong way of checking the ISO image [[!wikipedia Authentication

	Tails.</strong></p>

	<p>Those techniques rely on standard HTTPS and [[!wikipedia
	Certificate_authority desc="certificate authorities"]] to make you
	trust the content of this website. But, [[as explained on our warning
	page|doc/warning#index3h1]], you could still be victim of a
	man-in-the-middle attack while using HTTPS. On this website as much as
	on any other of the Internet.</p>

	<p>It is anyway a good thing to check the ISO image integrity first. We
	will propose you after that some more advanced techniques to <a
	href="#authenticity-check">check the authenticity of the ISO
	image</a>.</p>

	<p>All Tails ISO image are cryptographically signed by our OpenPGP key.
	OpenPGP is a standard for data encryption that provides cryptographic
	privacy and authentication through the use of keys owned by its users.
	Checking this signature is the recommended way of checking the ISO image
	integrity.</p>

	<h2>Using Linux with Gnome: Ubuntu, Debian, Tails, Fedora, etc.</h2>

	<p>You need to have the <code>seahorse-plugins</code> package
	installed. If you're not sure or want to install it, under Debian,
	Ubuntu or Tails you can issue the following commands:</p>

<pre>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install seahorse-plugins
</pre>

	<p>First, download [[!tails_website tails-signing.key desc="Tails

	<p>Your browser should propose you to open it with "Import Key". Choose
	this action. It will add Tails signing key to your keyring, the

	<h2>Using Linux with the command line</h2>

	<p>You need to have GnuPG installed. GnuPG is the common OpenPGP
	implementation for Linux: it is installed by default under Debian,
	Ubuntu, Tails and many other distributions.</p>

	<p>First, download [[!tails_website tails-signing.key desc="Tails
	signing key"]].</p>

	<p>Open a terminal and import Tails signing key with the following
	commands:</p>

<pre>
cd [the directory in which you downloaded the key]
cat tails-signing.key | gpg --import
</pre>

	<p>The output should tell you that the key was imported:</p>

gpg: key BE2CD9C1: public key "T(A)ILS developers (signing key) <amnesia@boum.org>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 2
gpg:               imported: 2  (RSA: 2)
</pre>

	<p>If you had already imported Tails signing key in the past, the output
	should tell you that the key was not changed:</p>

<pre>
gpg: key F93E735F: "Amnesia <amnesia@boum.org>" not changed

	<h2>Using other operating systems</h2>

	<h3>Using Firefox</h3>

	<p>This technique is not using the cryptographic signature as the others
	do. We propose it because it's especially easy for Windows users.</p>

	<p>Install the CheckIt extension for Firefox available <a
	href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/checkit/">here</a>
	and restart Firefox.</p>

	<p>Here is the checksum (a kind of digital fingerprint) of the ISO
	image. Select it with your cursor:</p>

	<pre>[[!inline pages="inc/stable_i386_hash" raw="yes"]]</pre>

	<p>Right-click on it and choose "Selected hash (SHA256)" from the
	contextual menu:</p>

	<p><img src="download/selected_hash.png"/></p>

	<p>From the dialog box that shows up, open the ISO image. Then wait for
	the checksum to compute. This will take several seconds during which
	your browser will be unresponsive.</p>

	<p><strong>If the ISO image is correct</strong> you will get a
	notification saying that the checksums match:</p>

	<p><img src="download/checksums_match.png"/></p>

	<p><strong>If the ISO image is not correct</strong> you will get a
	notification telling you that the checksums do not match:</p>

	<p><img src="download/checksums_do_not_match.png"/></p>

	<h3>Using the cryptographic signature</h3>

	<p>GnuPG, a common free software implementation of OpenPGP has versions
	and graphical frontends for both Windows and Mac OS X. This also make it
	possible to check the cryptographic signature with those operating
	systems:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>[[Gpg4win|http://www.gpg4win.org/]], for Windows</li>
	  <li>[[GPGTools|http://www.gpgtools.org/]], for Mac OS X</li>
	</ul>

	<p>You will find on either of those websites detailed documentation on
	how to install and use them.</p>

	<h3>For Windows using Gpg4win</h3>

	<p>After installing Gpg4win, download [[!tails_website tails-signing.key
	desc="Tails signing key"]].</p>

	<p>[[Consult the Gpg4win documentation to import
	it|http://www.gpg4win.org/doc/en/gpg4win-compendium_15.html]]</p>

	<p>Then, download the cryptographic signature corresponding to the ISO
	image you want to verify:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li><a href=[[!inline pages="inc/stable_i386_sig_url" raw="yes"]]>

	</ul>

	<p>[[Consult the Gpg4win documentation to check the
	signature|http://www.gpg4win.org/doc/en/gpg4win-compendium_24.html#id4]]</p>

	<h3>For Mac OS X using GPGTools</h3>

	<p>After installing GPGTools, you should be able to follow the
	instruction <a href="#verify-the-iso-with-terminal">using Linux with the
	command line</a>. To open the command line, navigate to your

	<p>Every ISO image we ship can be either burn on a CD or installed onto a USB stick.</p>

	<h2>Burning a CD</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>CDs are read-only so your Tails can't be altered by a virus or an

	image by the Tails ISO image you downloaded and ignore the part on
	verifying the data integrity since you've already done that.</p>

	<h2>Installing onto a USB stick</h2>

	<p><strong>The content of the USB stick will be lost in the

	<ul>
	  <li>An attacker with physical access to your USB stick or through a

	<h1>5. Stay tuned</h1>

	<p>
	<strong>It's very important to keep your Tails version up-to-date, otherwise
	your system will be vulnerable to numerous security holes.</strong> The
	development team is doing its best to release new versions fixing known
	security holes on a regular basis.
	</p>

	<p>New versions are announced on:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>our <a href='https://boum.org/mailman/listinfo/amnesia-news'>news

	available BitTorrent files.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Refer to our [[security announcements|/security]] feed for more
	detailed information about the security holes affecting Tails.
	Furthermore you will be automatically notified of the security holes
	affecting the version you are using at the startup of a new Tails
	session.</p>

	<p>Since Tails is based on Debian, it takes advantages of the all of the
	work done by the Debian security team. As quoted from <a
	href="http://security.debian.org/">(http://security.debian.org/)</a>:</p>

	<blockquote>Debian takes security very seriously. We handle all
	security problems brought to our attention and ensure that they are
	corrected within a reasonable timeframe. Many advisories are coordinated
	with other free software vendors and are published the same day a
	vulnerability is made public and we also have a Security Audit team that
	reviews the archive looking for new or unfixed security bugs.
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>Experience has shown that "security through obscurity" does
	not work. Public disclosure allows for more rapid and better solutions
	to security problems. In that vein, this page addresses Debian's status
	with respect to various known security holes, which could potentially
	affect Debian.</blockquote>

	<h1>6. Starting Tails!</h1>

	<p>Now that you have a Tails CD or USB stick you can shutdown your
	computer and start using Tails without altering your existing operating
	system.</p>

	<p><strong>If you're using a CD:</strong> Put the Tails CD into the
	CD/DVD-drive and restart the computer. You should see a welcome screen
	prompting you to choose your language.</p>

	<p>If you don't get this menu, you can consult the Ubuntu documentation
	about <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootFromCD">booting

	<p><strong>If you're using a USB stick:</strong> Shutdown the computer,
	plug in your USB stick and start the computer. You should see a welcome
	screen prompting you to choose your language.</p>

	<p>If your computer does not automatically do so, you might need to edit
	the BIOS settings. Restart your computer, and watch for a message
	telling you which key to press to enter the BIOS setup. It will usually
	be one of F1, F2, DEL, ESC or F10. Press this key while your computer is
	booting to edit your BIOS settings. You need to edit the Boot Order.
	Depending on your computer you should see an entry for 'removable drive'
	or 'USB media'. Move this to the top of the list to force the computer
	to attempt to boot from USB before booting from the hard disk. Save your
	changes and continue.</p>
