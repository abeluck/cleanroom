	<h1>3. Verify the ISO image</h1>

	<p>It is important to check the [[!wikipedia Data_integrity
	desc="integrity"]] of the ISO image you downloaded to make sure that the
	download went well.</p>

	<p><strong>Warning: the following techniques don't provide you with a
	strong way of checking the ISO image [[!wikipedia Authentication
	desc="authenticity"]] and making sure you downloaded a genuine
	Tails.</strong></p>

	<p>Those techniques rely on standard HTTPS and [[!wikipedia
	Certificate_authority desc="certificate authorities"]] to make you trust
	the content of this website. But, [[as explained on our warning
	page|doc/warning#index3h1]], you could still be victim of a
	man-in-the-middle attack while using HTTPS. On this website as much as
	on any other.</p>

	<p>It is anyway a good thing to check the ISO image integrity first. We
	will propose you after that a more advanced technique to <a

	<p>Open a terminal and go to the directory of as the ISO image:</p>

	<pre>cd [your iso image directory]</pre>

	<p>Then run the following command to check the integrity of the ISO
	image against the .sha256 file:</p>

	<pre>sha256sum -c tails*.iso.sha256</pre>

	<p>If your ISO image is correct you will get something like:</p>

<p>Users of a recent enough GNOME should make sure they have the

the <code>.asc</code> OpenPGP signature file, and open it with the
<emph>Verify signature</emph> tool.</p>

<p>Others rather need to do this on the command-line, in the directory
where the <code>.iso</code> and <code>.asc</code> files are:</p>

<pre>
gpg --verify tails*.iso.asc
</pre>
	</div>

	<h2><a name="authenticity-check"></a>So how can I check better the ISO
	image authenticity?</h2>

	<p>If you want to be extra cautious and authenticate a Tails ISO image
	in a stronger way than what standard HTTPS offers you, you will need to
	use the OpenPGP Web of Trust.</p>

	<p>One of the inherent problems of standard HTTPS is that the trust we
	usually put on a website is defined by certificate authorities: a
	hierarchical and closed set of companies and governmental institutions
	approved by web vendors. This model of trust has long been critized and
	proved several times to be vulnerable to attacks [[as explained on our
	warning page|doc/warning#index3h2]].</p>

	<p>We believe instead that users should be given the final say when
	trusting a website, and that designation of trust should be done on the
	basis of human interaction.</p>

	<p>The OpenPGP [[!wikipedia Web_of_Trust desc="Web of Trust"]] is a
	decentralized trust model based on OpenPGP keys. OpenPGP is a standard
	for data encryption and decryption that provides cryptographic privacy
	and authentication through the use of key owned by its users.</p>

	<p>All Tails ISO image are signed by our OpenPGP key and finding a way
	of trusting Tails' key could allow you to authenticate better the ISO
	image you downloaded by verifying this signature. Let's see that with an
	example.</p>

	<p><em>You're a friend of Alice and really trust her way of managing
	OpenPGP keys. You're trusting Alice's key.</em></p>

	<p><em>Furthermore, Alice met Bob, a Tails developper, in a conference,
	and signed Bob's key. Alice is trusting Bob's key.</em></p>

	<p><em>Bob is a Tails developper who directly owns the Tails' key. Bob
	fully trusts Tails' key.</em></p>

	<p>This scenario creates a trust path from you to Tails' key that could
	allow you to trust Tails' key without having to depend on certicate
	authorities.</p>

	<p>This trust model is not perfect either and requires both caution and
	intelligent supervision by users. The technical details of creating,
	managing and trusting OpenPGP keys is outside of the scope of this
	document.</p>

	<p><strong>If you never used OpenPGP before</strong> and since the Web
	of Trust is actually based on human relationships and real-life
	interactions you will need to start establishing contacts with people
	knowledgeable about OpenPGP and start building trust relationships in
	order to find a trust path to Tails' key. You could start by contacting
	a local [[!wikipedia Linux_User_Group desc="%s"]] or other Tails
	enthousiasts near you.</p>

	<h1>4. Burn a CD or install onto a USB stick</h1>

	<p>Every ISO image we ship can be either burn on a CD or installed onto a USB stick.</p>

	<p><strong>Burning a CD</strong></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>CDs are read-only so your Tails can't be altered by a virus or an
	  attacker.</li>
	  <li>CDs are cheap but you will need to burn a new CD each time you
	  will update your Tails version.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>For detailed instructions on how to burn an ISO image you can consult
	the corresponding Ubuntu documentation, just replace the Ubuntu ISO
	image by the Tails ISO image you downloaded:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto#Ubuntu">
	  Linux with Gnome: Tails, Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc.</a></li>

	<p><strong>Installing onto a USB stick</strong> (the content of the USB

	<ul>
	  <li>An attacker with physical access to your USB stick or through a
	  virus could alter your Tails.</li>
	  <li>USB sticks can be reused across Tails versions.</li>
	  <li>USB sticks are smaller to fit in your pocket.</li>
	  <li>Older computers might not be able to start from a USB stick.</li>
	  <li>This technique also works for [[!wikipedia SD_card desc="SD

	<h1>5. Stay tuned</h1>

	<p>
	<strong>It's very important to keep your Tails version up-to-date, otherwise
	your system will be vulnerable to numerous security holes.</strong> The
	development team is doing its best to release new versions fixing known
	security holes on a regular basis.
	</p>

	<p>New versions are announced on:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>our <a href='https://boum.org/mailman/listinfo/amnesia-news'>news
	mailing-list</a></li>
	<li>our <a href='torrents/rss/index.rss'>RSS</a> and <a

	available BitTorrent files.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Refer to our [[security announcements|/security]] feed for more
	detailed information about the security holes affecting Tails.
	Furthermore you will be automatically notified of the security holes
	affecting the version you are using at the startup of a new Tails
	session.</p>

	<p>Since Tails is based on Debian, it takes advantages of the all of the
	work done by the Debian security team. As quoted from <a
	href="http://security.debian.org/">(http://security.debian.org/)</a>:</p>

	<blockquote>Debian takes security very seriously. We handle all
	security problems brought to our attention and ensure that they are
	corrected within a reasonable timeframe. Many advisories are coordinated
	with other free software vendors and are published the same day a
	vulnerability is made public and we also have a Security Audit team that
	reviews the archive looking for new or unfixed security bugs.
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>Experience has shown that "security through obscurity" does
	not work. Public disclosure allows for more rapid and better solutions
	to security problems. In that vein, this page addresses Debian's status
	with respect to various known security holes, which could potentially
	affect Debian.</blockquote>

	<h1>6. Starting Tails!</h1>

	<p>Now that you have a Tails CD or USB stick you can shutdown your
	computer and start using Tails without altering your existing operating
	system.</p>

	<p><strong>If you're using a CD:</strong> Put the Tails CD into the
	CD/DVD-drive and restart the computer. You should see a welcome screen
	prompting you to choose your language.</p>

	<p>If you don't get this menu, you can consult the Ubuntu documentation
	about <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootFromCD">booting
	from the CD</a> for more information, especially the part on the <a
	href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootFromCD#BIOS%20is%20not%20set%20to%20boot%20from%20CD%20or%20DVD%20drive">
	BIOS settings</a>.</p>

	<p><strong>If you're using a USB stick:</strong> Shutdown the computer,
	plug in your USB stick and start the computer. You should see a welcome
	screen prompting you to choose your language.</p>

	<p>If your computer does not automatically do so, you might need to edit
	the BIOS settings. Restart your computer, and watch for a message
	telling you which key to press to enter the BIOS setup. It will usually
	be one of F1, F2, DEL, ESC or F10. Press this key while your computer is
	booting to edit your BIOS settings. You need to edit the Boot Order.
	Depending on your computer you should see an entry for 'removable drive'
	or 'USB media'. Move this to the top of the list to force the computer
	to attempt to boot from USB before booting from the hard disk. Save your
	changes and continue.</p>
