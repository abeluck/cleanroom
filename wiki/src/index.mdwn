amnesia is a **Live System** ([Live CD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_CD), [Live USB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_USB)) aimed at preserving your privacy:

* any outgoing connection to the Internet is forced to go through the Tor network
* no trace is left on local storage devices unless explicitely asked.

It has many other [[features]].

## using amnesia

One can get the source code needed to [[build]] her own
amnesia Live System using the Debian Live tools:

* as a [[tarball]]
* with [[git]] 

One might be able to [[download]] pre-built images... someday.
