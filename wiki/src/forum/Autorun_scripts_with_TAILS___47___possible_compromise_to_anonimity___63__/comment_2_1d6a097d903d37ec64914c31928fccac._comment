Thanks for kind reply.

commenting on using sudo for deletion, the file keeps coming back each time TAILS starts.

How to permanently delete the file, like from live cd image ?

Also, I can see same file in one other location other than usr/local/bin. Is deleting the file from that location only sufficient to prevent it from running?

If not, what should be done?
