I use the vi/vim editor to edit the /etc/torrc file as root:
$ sudo -i (This command gets you into root account)
# vi /etc/torrc
<press Shift key>G (Note: this puts you at the end of the file, where I add the following lines)
<press i key> (This gets you into insert mode in vi/vim)
# Try for at most NUM seconds when building circuits. If the circuit isn't
# open in that time, give up on it. (Default: 1 minute.)
CircuitBuildTimeout 5
# Send a padding cell every N seconds to keep firewalls from closing our
# connections while Tor is not in use.
KeepalivePeriod 60
# Force Tor to consider whether to build a new circuit every NUM seconds.
NewCircuitPeriod 15
# How many entry guards should we keep at a time?
NumEntryGuards 8
<press Shift key>:wq (This exits the /etc/torrc file and ends the edit)
# exit (This exits root account)
