"We have seen problems running wireless adapters with the ath5k driver on "
"Lenny's kernel. Such problems are solved by upgrading to the Squeeze "
"kernel. So: please wait a bit, in a few weeks (maybe two months) a new "
"T(A)ILS release will be based on Squeeze, thus supporting far more hardware "
"devices, especially wireless adapters."
