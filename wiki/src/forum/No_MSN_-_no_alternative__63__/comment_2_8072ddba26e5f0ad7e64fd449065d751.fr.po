"You probably did not compile Pidgin with SSL support, or the SSL plugin "
"failed to load. The MSN protocol requires the use of SSL, which Pidgin "
"provides by either GnuTLS or the combination of NSS and NSPR from the "
"Mozilla project. See these notes (http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/FAQssl)  "
"to get SSL up and running."
