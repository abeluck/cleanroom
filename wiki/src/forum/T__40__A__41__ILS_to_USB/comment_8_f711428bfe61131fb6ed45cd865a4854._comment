I have the same problem, first I could not boot Live CD, then I went to library and I succeeded to boot there, but in the end, there was no shortcut for installation guide...amnesia was fake hope for several days in my life. some people created something what function only for them, but never mind, when hope is gone, everything is the same as before:) prison wait for rebels, in any case, before or later.
