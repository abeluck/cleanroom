Hi, I just burned tails 0.8 on CD and first time with 24x speed and I could not boot CD (init file error, I think it is in kernel or something like that), then I burnt iso file again, this time with 16x speed and now I can boot tails live CD. I checked open-office, gedit, firefox, it all works, except Virtual Keyboard Florence. I can open florence, I can check settings, but when I type, there is no result. simply, pressing buttons in florence doesn't work. in florence settings, everything is okay, there is activated button option. I tried to type in gedit, in firefox, but without result.
