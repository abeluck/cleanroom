Is it possible/smart or even "logical" to use Tails with this type of setup:

Open Wifi > VPN > RDP/VPS > VMWare Tails > Socks5 > Browse Web 

If this setup is even remotely possible:

1. Is it "redundant"?
2. Does it actually open up more possibilities of being tracked?
3. Is it in the right order?

BTW: VPS/RDP/VPN providers I will use are trusted sources. 
I need to include the use of socks because it gives me more flexibility. 

Any feedback or suggestions will be appreciated!!
