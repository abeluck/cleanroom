Hi, if I:

-spoof MAC address of wireless card
-use networkmanager
-try to connect to AP with WPA encryption

it doesn`t connect. My Archlinux home installation has exactly the same problem, so I switched to wicd.
 
If I replace networkmanager with wicd in Tails, it can connect with spoofed MAC, but breaks the whole system. For example, I can`t launch unsafe browser with error of something like "no DNS, wrong DHCP, blah-blah". And Tor doesn`t work, of course.

Any thoughts?
