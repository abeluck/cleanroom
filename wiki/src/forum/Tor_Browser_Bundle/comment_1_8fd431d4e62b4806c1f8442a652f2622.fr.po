"In T(A)ILS all outgoing connections to the Internet are forced to go through "
"the Tor network, which means that you don't have to worry about a "
"misconfigured application connecting to the internet directly, thus exposing "
"your real identity. In addition to that, it is an isolated and "
"pre-configured system, which means that any data that can be harvested about "
"the operating system (e.g. through javascript) will not identify you (for "

"defeat the whole purpose of using Tor and other anonymity and privacy "

"undetectable by anti-virus software. Even old malware can be made "
"undetectable using various undetection techniques."
