I'm a noob too, but I'll try and answer your question.



First, you should probably read this:

https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/torbutton-faq.html.en#noflash



If you still want to install flash then here are my instructions.


WARNING!

I'm a noob (I don't have any technical knowlege) but, i expect that...


FOLLOWING THESE INSTRUCTIONS WILL RUIN YOUR ANONYMITY!




The information you want is here:

http://wiki.debian.org/FlashPlayer


Here are the full instructions
------------------------------

You're looking for flashplugin-nonfree. Go to:

http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/i386/flashplugin-nonfree/download

Choose your mirror and download.

You then need to install it. So:

Open terminal.
$ su
(the password is amnesia)

Change folder to where you downloaded the package:
# cd Downloads

Install the plugin.
# dpkg -i flashplugin-nonfree_2.8.2_i386.deb

Upgrade the flash player.
# update-flashplugin-nonfree --install


You now have flash installed.

It probably still doesn't work though. What you need to do is:

Click the Torbutton in your browser and select Preferences.
Choose the Security Settings/Dynamic Content tab.
Uncheck the Disable plugins during Tor usage checkbox.
Restart your browser.

YOU NOW HAVE FLASH. Unfortunately (and I'm a noob too, so I'm just assuming this is true) YOU NO LONGER HAVE ANONYMITY!
