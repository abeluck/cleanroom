"First, note that such an installed system can actually be considered as a "
"**fork** of T(A)ILS: after this process has been completed, any "
"privacy/security/anonymity issue discovered in T(A)ILS will need to be fixed "
"inside the forked system *by its administrator*. Debian security support is "
"of course pretty good, but it covers neither the specific privacy/anonymity "
"leaks we have discovered (and fixed) in T(A)ILS in the past... nor the ones "
"that we will discover (and fix) in the future. I really want to insist: once "
"you have completed this installation process, you are on your own and you "
"need to closely follow the T(A)ILS security announces (if not its whole "
"development)  unless you are happy with a false sense of security."
