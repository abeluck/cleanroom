WARNING TO ALL USERS OF TAILS - UNCONFIRMED

I believe the website had been hacked. Please do not download Tails until this has been clarified.

I believe that this is the case since a new copy of tails has been uploaded to replace the previous version. This can be found by viewing the "Last Modified" date of the uploaded files at:

http://dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails/stable/tails-i386-0.12.1/

The PGP signature has also been recently replaced with a new version.

20-Aug-2012 15:20 Is the new file modified date and there has been no announcement for this.

Please do not download tails at this time.

The tails forum also appears to have been hacked to include words such as cociane and PCP in the introductory text.
