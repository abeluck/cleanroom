I rememer trying tails quite a long time ago and disliking it much. Problem is I have no recollection why. I just tried it today and it works wonderfuly. 

Only that, for me it's rather bloaty. I would have preffered some OpenOffice/MicrosoftOffice reader instead of the whole suite, but there's not much of a choice in this area anyway. Scribus I use from time to time. And I am aware that somebody might try to use all these packs to edit a newspaper. It's a miracle given the way people were restricted by even the smallest printing press about a century ago!

So I would remove all these large packs, leave the firefox addon configuration for the sake of anonimity. But I already use TrueCrypt and I want it enabled no matter what. Also I use KeePass. KeePassX is the Linux equivalent. And it's small and portable. There is even a java version for my phone. Also sdd KeyNote NF and VLC player.

On a second thought, as the price of slow USB sticks is low, I might leave the large Office packs there, but I need those extra packs
