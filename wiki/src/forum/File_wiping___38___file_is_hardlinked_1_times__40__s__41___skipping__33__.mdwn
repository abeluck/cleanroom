I have a lot of files I needed to wipe and each time I get an error window that says:

    Wipe failed.
    
    [path/filename.ext] - file is hardlinked 1 times(s) skipping!
    
    \/ Details
    Subprocess failed.
    [path/filename.ext] - file is hardlinked 1 times(s) skipping!
    
    [Close]

As a work around I found that renaming the file allows it to be wiped.  Does this work around have security risks and why does it happen?
