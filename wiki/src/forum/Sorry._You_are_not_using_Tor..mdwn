"Sorry. You are not using Tor." At least, that what Tor Check says.

Every other indication is that I am using Tor. But the red lettering and the big red X over the black onion logo is still enough to make me concerned.

So, should I be worried?


Additional info:

Tor check reports that my "IP address appears to be: 38.229.70.31". The hostname for this address is sergii.torproject.org.
