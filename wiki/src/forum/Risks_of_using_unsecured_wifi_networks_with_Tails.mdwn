Hi,

First of all my compliments and thanks to the developers of Tails and Tor for these great tools of freedom! I would recommend everybody to donate money!

I use Tails on live USB and often connect to unsecured wifi networks. I have a special computer for this without a hard drive. I never download/open any file through these unsecured networks and I also spoof my MAC. I don't share any personal information, habits etc. Are there still risks for my anonymity? Are there still digital risks / ways to link me to the hardware I have at home.

I mean, is it theoretically possible (when a hacker joins also the same unsecured wifi network) to infect a computer (RAM-memory / Live USB / Bios) with a virus while running Tails on live USB? 

Can a hacker/ISP read my hardware while being connected to a unsecured network? Or is the standard firewall in Tails strong enough to prevent that? 

Imagining when they first would read out my hardware (for example serial number of my motherboard, monitor, used USB-devices, the permanenent hard coded MAC of my network card etc.) and afterwards they do a physical house search in the near area of the router that sends out the wifi signal I'm using, they will find those hardware in my house.

Can they also, while I'm connected to a unsecured network, see the destination of my Tor-surfing when using Iceweasel? Or is that well encrypted and difficult to decrypt/see?
