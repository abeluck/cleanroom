Then what do we do to fix the incorrect local time? 

I opened a terminal and corrected system time using the date command then restarted tor and polipo from the /etc/init.d scripts.   Tor then worked but seemed to work much slower and timed out on many page fetches.

Tor works fine with this wrong time but is it a Bad Thing(TM)?
