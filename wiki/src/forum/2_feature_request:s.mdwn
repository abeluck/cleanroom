Hello!

Basically, I have two feature requests:

1) Persistence. I know it's in the roadmap somewhere, but I want it very bad, so I mention it here.

2) Mixminion w/GUI included by default.

Mixminion is pretty nifty and it looks like project is entering active development again (announced on 2 sept. 2011)
