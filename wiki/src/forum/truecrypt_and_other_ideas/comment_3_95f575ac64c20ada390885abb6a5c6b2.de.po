"OK, I will test proxy settings when new version will be released. Now it "
"works off-line only (absolutely safe though :P). I also used Incognito "
"because it was the only Live distro with Truecrypt, Tor and OpenOffice. I do "
"believe that TrueCrypt is free enough to be included in privacy-focused "
"system. For me - if source is available, program is safe. More encryption "
"available - more fun."
