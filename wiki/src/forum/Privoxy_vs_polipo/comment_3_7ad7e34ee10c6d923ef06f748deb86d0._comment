Interesting (I am the OP). I was aware that sockification for FF/Iceweasel was no longer needed, I was thinking more about Privoxy's advanced sanitation/filtering features.  The vast majority of web pages are not https:// so this does not make Privoxy's filtering irrelevant (though it does make browser settings important).

Good point about being able to point wget and curl through Privoxy to filter pages and also being able to use different proxies for i2P and tor.

I was aware that sockification for FF/Iceweasel was no longer needed, I was thinking more about Privoxy's advanced sanitation/filtering features. Good point though about being able to point wget and curl through Privoxy to filter pages and also being able to separate out i2P from tor traffic.

I assume web bugs (crushed by Privoxy by default) are not an issue since any traffic from a bug goes out through tor.

What I was wondering about was this: since Polipo doesn't really do any filtering, is it possible to imagine a threat model/exploit that Privoxy might guard against better than relying on browser settings + Polipo alone?
