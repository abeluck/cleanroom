Interesting (I am the OP).  I was aware that sockification for FF/Iceweasel was no longer needed, I was thinking more about Privoxy's advanced sanitation/filtering features.  Good point though about being able to point wget and curl through Privoxy to filter pages and also being able to separate out i2P from tor traffic.

I assume web bugs (crushed by Privoxy by default) are not an issue since any traffic from a bug goes out through tor.

What I was wondering about was this: since Polipo doesn't really do any filtering, is it possible to imagine a threat model/exploit that Privoxy might guard against better than relying on browser settings + Polipo alone?
