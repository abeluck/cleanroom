"It is not possible at the moment. T(A)ILS is designed as a LiveDistro which "
"traditionally meant that it runs from read-only media (in particular "
"CD/DVD). It is not among it goals to be installed to a hard drive, and it "
"likely will never be. That is not due to laziness, it is a concious, thought "
"through decision. That mode of operation is simply more desirable for what "
"we try to give our users with T(A)ILS, the \\\"amnesic\\\" part, i.e. that "
"it shouldn't leave any traces after a session has been closed down."

"There is a compomise in the works, though. If you're familiar with the old "
"Incognito LiveCD you might remember that it was possible to have your home "
"partition mounted persistantly in an encrypted container. Once that is in "
"place in T(A)ILS you will be able to configure your applications so that it "
"will be saved through reboots. At the moment that is not easily done, "
"though. And I'm not sure how well that will play with virtual machines like "
"VMWare or VirtualBox (when I developed Incognito I never found out a nice "
"solution to do it that didn't require a lot of extra work)."
