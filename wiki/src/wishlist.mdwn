[[!meta title="wishlist"]]

These [[todo]] tagged 'wishlist' encompass all kinds of features and
improvements people would like to see in amnesia. Good patches for any
of these will likely be accepted.

* Please update Torbutton to 1.2.3 or later. There are very annoying bugs in previous versions, some of which have security implications. The current version, 1.2.1, is a whole year old.
* If you update Firefox to 3.5 or later, be sure to turn off geolocation from the beginning in the browser preferences. New versions of Torbutton disable geolocation, but only when Torbutton is in "enabled" mode. It may also be a good idea to disable prefetching.
