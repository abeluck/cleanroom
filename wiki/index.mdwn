amnesia is a **Live System** ([Live CD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_CD), [Live USB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_USB)) aimed at preserving your privacy:

* any outgoing connection to the Internet is forced to go through the Tor network
* no trace is left on local storage devices unless explicitely asked.

It has many other [[features]].

## using amnesia

One can get the [[source code|git]] needed to build her own
amnesia Live System using the Debian Live tools.

On the other hand, one might be able to [[download]] pre-built
images... someday.

## resources

[[Bugs]], [[TODO]] items, [[wishlist]] items, and [[patches|patch]]
can be submitted and tracked using this wiki.

## acknowledgements

* amnesia would never exist without [Debian Live](http://debian-live.alioth.debian.org/)
* amnesia was inspired by the [Incognito LiveCD](http://anonymityanywhere.com/incognito/) and the [Privatix Live-System](http://mandalka.name/privatix/)
